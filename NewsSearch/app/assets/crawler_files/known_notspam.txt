Man Threatens Explosion In Moscow 
Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PM
MOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man who
said he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in
front of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTV
television reported.
The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man
got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details
were immediately available.
The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and
ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to
talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within
blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the
man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news
agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside
the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.
The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove
to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held
further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The
move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more
secure location.

Klez: The Virus That Won't Die
Already the most prolific virus ever, Klez continues to wreak havoc.
Andrew Brandt
Posted Thursday, August 01, 2002
The Klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across 
the Web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. And 
experts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a 
combination of pernicious approaches to go from PC to PC.
Antivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee both report more than 
2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The 
British security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300 
e-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that 
Klez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific 
virus ever.
And some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry 
other viruses in them that corrupt your data.

I just had to jump in here as Carbonara is one of my favourites to make and ask 
what the hell are you supposed to use instead of cream?  I've never seen a 
recipe that hasn't used this.  Personally I use low fat creme fraiche because it 
works quite nicely but the only time I've seen an supposedly authentic recipe 
for carbonara  it was identical to mine (cream, eggs and lots of fresh parmesan) 
except for the creme fraiche.

Isn't it just basically a mixture of beaten egg and bacon (or pancetta,

cooks the egg. That's my understanding.

 Playboy wants to go out with a bang 
 AN AGEING Berlin playboy has come up with an unusual offer to lure women into
 his bed - by promising the last woman he sleeps with an inheritance of 250,000
 (£160,000). 
 Rolf Eden, 72, a Berlin disco owner famous for his countless sex partners,
 said he could imagine no better way to die than in the arms of an attractive
 young woman - preferably under 30. 
 "I put it all in my last will and testament - the last woman who sleeps with
 me gets all the money," Mr Eden told Bild newspaper. 
 "I want to pass away in the most beautiful moment of my life. First a lot of
 fun with a beautiful woman, then wild sex, a final orgasm - and it will all
 end with a heart attack and then I’m gone." 
 Mr Eden, who is selling his nightclub this year, said applications should be
 sent in quickly because of his age. "It could end very soon," he said.

 Meaningful sentences 
 Tracey Lawson 
 If you ever wanted to look like "one of the most dangerous inmates in prison
 history", as one judge described Charles Bronson, now’s your chance. Bronson -
 the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and
 fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary
 muscle power. 
 Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,
 has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he
 has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a
 day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at
 virtually no cost. 
 The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a
 fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and
 starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the
 exercise industry. 
 "I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it," is the
 opening paragraph penned by Bronson. "It’s a joke and a big con and they call
 me a criminal!" You can’t help feeling he has a point. 
 This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having
 already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems
 created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to
 discover creative expression while residing at Her Majesty’s pleasure. 
 Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents
 when he was sent to Barlinnie Prison’s famous special unit, which aimed to
 help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to
 express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the
 murder of "Babs" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he
 has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was
 published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an
 award-winning film. 
 Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in
 Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison
 officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being
 transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and
 developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,
 a frank account of Glasgow’s criminal culture in the 1960s, which received
 critical praise. 
 And Lord Archer doesn’t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books
 that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book
 deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubt
 scribbling away as we speak. 
 So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so
 destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck
 on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronson’s publisher, has published many books
 about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both
 pragmatic and profound. 
 He says: "Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have
 known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the
 chance to focus on their creative skills. 
 "It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an
 education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time
 anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents." 
 However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:
 "Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine
 the very essence of who they are. 
 "They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or
 am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something
 good?" 
 Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that
 of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered
 mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed
 robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term
 over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was
 jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly
 two days during a jail siege. 
 Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is
 renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands
 and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: "I can hit
 a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds." 
 But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary
 Fitness might be the book which will see Bronson’s face sitting on every
 coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which
 so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because
 Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. 
 "All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, it’s just a load of
 bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket," he writes, in what can only be
 described as a refreshingly honest style. "We can all be fat lazy bastards,
 it’s our choice, I’m sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff
 your face with shit you become shit, that’s logical to me." 
 As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside
 we all needed. 
 Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will
 be available in bookstores from October at £7.99

root=/dev/hda5, not /dev/md0 was because /dev/md0 wasn't booting - it
would barf with 'can't find init'.
 It turns out that this is because I was populating md0 with tar. Which
seems to have 'issues' with crosslinked files - for instance, it was
trying to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and failing. It was only
as I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and
queried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist on
the new rootfs.
 When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar, it worked
fine, I was able to tell lilo to use root=/dev/md0 and everything worked.
 Woohoo.

SpamAssassin is hurting democracy!
Internet can level the political playing field
By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro
NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 
of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 
malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 
stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 
public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 
personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 
ask for our votes.
Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 
has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.
In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 
Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 
addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 
each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.
That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 
expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 
spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 
35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.
Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 
been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 
would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 
through any of those channels.
The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 
was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 
entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 
refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 
``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.
His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 
because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 
may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money 
in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication 
mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.
No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 
highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 
it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 
unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.
The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 
that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 
believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 
TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 
simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 
future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 
taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.
When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 
Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them 
to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 
percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail 
accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.
Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 
Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better 
ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient 
But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter 
an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without 
opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage 
the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam 
advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 
Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 
they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.
Mike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an 
advocacy management and communications software company. Larry Purpuro, 
the former Republican National Committee deputy chief of staff, is 
founder and president of a political e-marketing firm. This was written 
for the Los Angeles Times.

 Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail.
 Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make
solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with
solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to
other unixen like HPUX and SCO.
 Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One
of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your
hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,
they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software
problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.
 If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There
is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,
though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.
 You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,
who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,
that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a
cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.

    "Wed, 21 Aug 2002 11:30:03 PDT."
When I'd read that "getting legal title
can take 20 years", when I believe that
1 year ought to be more than sufficient,
(and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd
assumed that we were talking about the
urban poor.
If I see people living in mansions, or
even in suburban subdivisions, I assume
they didn't have too much trouble with
their titles.
If I see people living in shanties and
haphazard alleyways, I tend to assume
their parcels weren't exactly recorded
on the government maps, or paid for with
a bank loan, especially when nearby vacant
lots have shotgun wielding men presumably
intent on keeping them "development" free.
Now, it may be that "Manhattanites' view
of America" to say that outside of Metro
Manila, Davao, and maybe another city or
two (Cebu?), everything else (literally)
is the boondocks.  But going on that very
broad assumption, I guess I'm describing
the flip side of Mr. Roger's experience:
the paisanos (who leave behind those who
remain on a patron's rural land) move to
Manila, and (the second assumption) squat
in shantytowns there, at least until they
can line up a middle-class job.
So, going on two large assumptions, I can
come up with a scenario under which title
would take 20 years: a shantytown arises
somewhere in the midst of a section (or
whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the
land) and it takes decades of arguing to
put together a package which somehow can
both compensate the owner and record lots
for the inhabitants.  Just transferring
title to an existing lot, between parties
who have money, ought not to be a problem.
The obvious solution, at least to us
barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is
to "introduce market mechanisms".  It is
left as an exercise to come up with one
which works when many of the agents (are
perceived to) have negligible NPV.
What happened to more highly-capitalized
land?  Putting in trees instead of crops
sounds like it might sidestep that.
On the "to find" list.  Any chance of
an explanation of that "Bell Jar" in
the meantime?

my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.
Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.
I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?
Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.
If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.
Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat? Opinions
Thanks a lot,

An apparent quote from Dubya, from the Times (sent to me by my Dad):
TONY BLAIR's special relationship with George W. Bush is under
considerable strain. Not only do the two disagree on Yassir Arafat's
tenure as leader of the Palestinian Authority, but Blair has started
telling disparaging anecdotes about the President.
Baroness Williams of Crosby recalled a story told to her by 'my good
friend Tony Blair' recently in Brighton. Blair, Bush and Jacques
Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of
the French economy. 'The problem with the French,' Bush confided in
Blair, 'is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.'

Claim:   President George W. Bush proclaimed, "The problem with

Origins:   Yet another French fried "George W. Bush is dumb"
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. "The problem with the
French," Bush afterwards confided in Blair, "is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur."
The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed "my good friend Tony Blair" had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.
Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. "I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,"
Campbell told The Post. "If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke."
This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the "village idiot" would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.
Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this
public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever
been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at
some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always
fall upon appreciative ears.

It will function as a router if that is what you wish.
It even looks like the modem's embedded OS is some kind of linux, being that
it has interesting interfaces like eth0.
I don't use it as a router though.... I just have it do the absolute minimum
DSL stuff and do all the really fun stuff like pppoe on my linux box........
Also the manual tells you what the default password is.
Don't forget to run pppoe over the alcatel speedtouch 350i as in my case you

spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody

Not true on the choice part.
After three weeks of me telling eircom that I did not in fact need nor want
their ?1800 worth of router and firewall
nor their onsite survey... for the uncapped service I actually managed to
get a 4 port modem (after asking for a 1 port modem) instead of ye olde
hardware router & firewall and eircom onsite.
I would have argued for the 1 port modem... (which I had asked for), but a
Director wanted the DSL up ... and fast....
Still it only took me three weeks to get (almost) what I

Is it just me or has there been a massive increase in the amount of email 
being falsely bounced around the place? I've already received email from a 
number of people I don't know, asking why I am sending them email. These 
can be explained by servers from Russia and elsewhere. Coupled with the 
false emails I received myself, it's really starting to annoy me. Am I the 
only one seeing an increase in recent weeks?

I am wondering whether there's a way that I can use sitescooper and/or plucker
or some other free utility to convert word documents into something a bit
more palmos friendly?
I don't have a Windows machine, so it becomes problematic to convert them;
I know that if this were not the case, in Word I could save them as some
other more friendly format.

for it's light-weight size, but OpenOffice has the better DOC importer.)
don't know which of these are better or worse than the other, but i
figure, "the more the merrier". ;-)
AbiWord supports exporting to PalmDoc (.pdb) which is about as
PalmOS-friendly as you can get.  never tried/needed it, but it's listed
there in the "Save As" dialog box.
Wine (or CrossOver Office, if you already have it) may support Word
Viewer (free download from Microsoft), but didn't a year or so ago when
i last tried.  Word Viewer is what i used back in the day to convert
Word 97 docs to Word 95, as you could display the Word 97 doc and copy &
paste the text (with formatting) into Word 95, which was the only
version of Word that i had.  anyways, a little nostalgia.
i have a windows (dual-boot) machine, but it only get used by my
significant other and for burning multi-session cd-r/rw.  (is there any
linux gui app that supports cdrecord's multi-session feature?)  since
OpenOffice, i've been able to edit Word docs flawlessly (or at least the
simple Word documents i receive from others).

         about a new open 802.11 network she's found. "I am here at

         that this weekend's multimedia performance of Jeff Wayne's WAR 
         OF THE WORLDS has been postponed due to "health and safety 
         issues". The event was to feature computer graphics, 
         fireworks, "60ft-tall Martian fighting machines" wreaking 
         "havoc and destruction", and - most terrifyingly of all - the 
         possibility of a David Essex tribute singer performing with 
         Hawkwind, but UKP18 tickets for the Sat 2002-08-31 show at 
         Manchester's Heaton Park will still be valid at a range of new 
         venues next summer. Ironically, the Martians' original 
         invasion plans were similarly thwarted by health and safety 
         issues, "slain after all man's devices had failed by the 
         humblest creatures that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this 
         earth: bacteria. Minute, invisible, bacteria. For, directly 
         the invaders arrived and drank and fed, our microscopic allies 
         attacked them..."

          mass of concentrated power in the middle, with a few small
          orbiting utilities - like WinZip, and PuTTY, and VNC.
          Occasionally one will get a bit too close to the OS, and
          Microsoft will suck it down and turn it into fuel for the
          System. One such discrete satellite remains FILEZILLA, the
          still-necessary ftp gui client for Windows. Those who know
          it won't need the introduction, although they might
          appreciate the note that it's getting close to v2.0 time.
          For dogged WS_FTP users, though, it's got multiple
          downloads, auto-restart of interrupted 'loads, queuing, and
          sftp and Kerberos support. It's also GPL'd which makes it a
          nice bit of source for anyone wanting to grok Win32

Gaim is an instant messaging client based on the published TOC
protocol from AOL. The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client
that combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in the
hyperlink handling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes an
untrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting,
permitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users
machine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the
user clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't
The fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser
command to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will
need to be amended, so they don't contain any quotes. The 'Manual'
browser command can be edited in the 'General' pane of the
'Preferences' dialog, which can be accessed by clicking 'Options' from
the login window, or 'Tools' and then 'Preferences' from the menu bar
in the buddy list window.

I am trying to rebuild the recently posted ALSA driver package for my

*Political spam on your cell phone?*
Special to ZDNet News
August 22, 2002, 12:05 PM PT
*In a decision that treats text messaging on mobile phones essentially 
the same as bumper stickers, the Federal Election Commission has 
declared that senders of text-based political ads don't have to disclose 
who funded them.*
In an advisory opinion issued Thursday, the FEC also suggested such 
messages include either a phone number or Web site link, so people could 
easily learn who paid for the message. However, the additional 
information won't be required.
The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as 
campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the 
same time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous 
political spam.
Target Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had 
asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring 
financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would 
use up too much of the 160 character-maximum.
Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from 
the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was 
supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular 
Telecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade 
FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the 
commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the 
potential to reach more voters.
"We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before 
everyone understands how the technology is going to work," he said.
Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or 
allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political 
messages while remaining anonymous.
Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.
Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as 
"good for America."
"It will allow people to receive more communication from those running 
for office," he said. "We have free speech on our side."

It doesn't work that way.  A website is opt-in, spam is no-opt.  If you

the worst that can be said is that you might have read it.  And as long as
the mailers send to individuals who clearly didn't opt-in, like party

Plus, it's much harder to block spam than web sites.

XviD [1] is a project to make GPL divx codecs. Sigma Designs [1] is a
company  looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things,
divx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not very
gpl. The  results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users to
put preasure  on Sigma to honor the GPL.
Some notes from other places....
"XviD development has been stopped! The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG-4
Video Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project.
Soon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developers
have contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation (for those
who don't know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License - GPL -
which demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release it
under the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigma
codec must be freely available). Sigma promised to replace the stolen
code, but the new version of the codec which was released this month only
disguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was once
again contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today
nothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the public
in the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince
Sigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter has
been resolved XviD development will not continue.
That being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads about
the Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now.
Internally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authors
first wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes
and kept quiet about the matter at hand.
[Update] Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of
the source code of their MPEG-4 codec and it's already up for download.
However, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press release
makes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so we
might be hearing more about this.
[Update] I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but it
also looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviD
doesn't get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collides
with Sigma's Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign before
downloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said they'd
fully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXn's relationship with
Sigma didn't really work out either, as Sigma's Xcard is not as DivX
compatible as it was advertised.
[Update]First an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigma
source code does not mean it's all over, it's far from being over. The
license agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, and
install the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can now
clearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself)
that the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all the
copyright notices of the original developers have been removed and
replaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws - you
can't just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyright
statements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on
your own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code taken
from the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 different
copyright notices which is quite funny."

"There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department
of Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against
individuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted
material over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes
that "criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to
preserve the viability of America's content industries." Malcolm also
believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are
participating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download
copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions
such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see
businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of
copyrighted works.
"Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think
they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal
prosecution," said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same
conference panel.
I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is
hoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or
warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor
deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits
carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate
further animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to
initiate because of the "schooling" effect of millions of systems
participating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from
the crowd.
The article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines
illegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:
Criminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for
purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the
reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any
180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more
copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....
For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution
of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish
willful infringement.
The term "financial gain" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of
anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.
Therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as "financial gain"
even if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the
value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15
to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the
perspective of the consumer or copyright holder.
The statute of limitations:
507. Limitations on actions
(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained
under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five
years after the cause of action arose.
(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the
provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after
the claim accrued.
The penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in
Section 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time
criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.
I'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to
prosecute because of the aforementioned "schooling" effect, but my guess
would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent
individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be
targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. Thanks to
MonaLisaOverdrive for pointing out this story.

There is a lot of C++ in the embedded world. With
static object allocation and a few other programming
techniques, performance differences disappear, but
C++ gives a boost in development and maintainability.
The real issue is compiler availability. Almost every

C++ compilers. But there is still a range of
platforms that have the first but not the second. Or
at least, that was the story a few years ago.

In my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and in

work on client's systems.
My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on
Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.
Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.
They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a
service pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to
run C programs.
Can't say I spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management
If your problem just requires application of a "design pattern" to solve,
then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language.
You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time
on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't.  Depends
entirely on the programmer, not the language.
Unsupported assertion.
Dunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC
in a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be
10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable
libraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.
At least that is the case when then language you used is available on
the target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.
You can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get
some kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for
maintenance headaches ad infinitum.
Whoah!!!  Performance matters to me every day.  (Right now I'm taking
time out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could
wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's
in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code
that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,
or I can do it now when very few people can.
It's true!  I admit everything!  Mea maxima culpa!  Working in C makes
me spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hard-core bitography!
Actually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.
Dunno, and frankly I don't see the relevance to the issue at hand.
I'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.  Horses for

I need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I've read, the the
choices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE.
It seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec which
is a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is
somewhat simpler to setup. 
The problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites
run OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of
IPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.
So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a
significant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ?
If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever
on the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote
sites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity
in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.

mailboxes and deliver the mail accordingly, although it appears that I have
to have only one unix user being able to receive from each pop3 mailbox.
This could be a limitation of the fetchmailconf programme, I'm not sure, but
It would be much handier if I could just tell it to collect all of the mail
from the different mailboxes, and then deliver it locally according to the
"To:" header instead of the pop3 mailbox it came from.
The other issue I am having is sending outgoing mail.  I have been trying to
use sendmail, but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior, and
when the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if I have
checked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes, and I don't know how
to set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail.  Do any of
the outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice'
configuration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configuration
files like sendmail.
Any suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated.  There
are only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up for
scheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me

Hi All,
I'm trying to set up the following:
1. A Linux server running with a modem for internet connectivity and an
ethernet card for LAN connectivity
2. Other LAN pcs with ethernet cards, using the Linux server for
DNS/DHCP etc.
Basically, I want to route any non LAN traffic through the ppp0.
I've got some of the way, but like a similar post earlier about modem
problems, when I am connected to the internet with eht0 up, the routing
is all incorrect and noting goes out through ppp0 (eh0 must be the
default route or something).
Is there standard "out of the box" Linux tools that will carry out
portmapping on behalf of the LAN PCs ?  (I'm planning on non routable
Can someone point me at the right HOWTOs or routing documentation I need
to follow ?

Once you have the serial changed on the master DNS server, remove
the appropiate zone(s) on your slaves, and refresh your DNS servers.
Bind has a special case, if you set the serial to '0' I think. DNS &
Bind should have something on that.

Your actual serial number is 1519761310 - from a dig I've just done.
Try resetting the zone number to 2002082901 - some of your secondaries seem 
to have a serial number below that, so they clearly regard 1519761310 as 
being less than 2002082601.
That should enable them to pick up the new zonefile.

STUDENT LIFE BEGINS WITH LINUX
John Sterne
The launch last month of a marketing special interest group by the
Irish Linux Users Group (ILUG)  -  open source and marketing, it
seems, might not be mutually exclusive concepts  -  has already
sparked an interesting initiative at University College Cork.  When
the new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student will
be offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.
ILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran a
training class for staff at the UCC computer science department.
Brelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that the
Linux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irish
The user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programme
that aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source
style of computing.  The Linux distributor runs an 'educational
channel' to reach this audience, bundling educational software
with its operating environment and offering networked support
services to eligible applicants.  This scheme was originally designed
to suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available to
schools and universities throughout the world.
Red Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenance
features and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard to
master on personal systems.
The Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of Red
Hat Ireland.  Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financial
services for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000.  Until now
its involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,
although it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices in
Europe that offer consulting or technical support services.
David Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production,
sees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to take
a more proactive approach.  In the last three months, he notes, his
office in Cork has received more and more calls from Irish
companies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introduced
some to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.
Many thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.

 Null, the third beta was out last week.
 It'll be an interesting release. Gnome 2.0, and GCC 3.2 - both very new,
large projects.
 I'd not be putting it on any production machines for a while...
 Though many say "RedHat X.0 releases are rubbish" - it's worth baring in
mind that they jump a release when the underlying archtechture changes, not
just the installer, so they are .0 for a reason.

Here's a weird and wacky problem:
I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I 
tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved 
pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd 
used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I 
was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having 
somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows 
and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. 
Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. 
Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where 
there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up 
and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection 
of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.
This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.
Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel 
that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?

 The only way you can resolve this, to my knowledge is to download the
original libvorbis rpm and the new one. Remove the old one, then do:
 rpm -Uvh libvorbis-*
 RPM then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time,
and does so. Why you can't do this after you have one library already
installed is beyond me.

It seems to only support PPPoA and not PPPoE. You need one that supports
PPPoE, if you want torun it in routed IP mode. If you are using it as a
bridge, it'll probably work, but you'd be left leaving the computer on,
which would defeat the purpose of getting a router.
The best router I've come accross is the Zyxel 643. Eircom supply this,
but if you have alook online you can probably find it cheaper to buy
online from America or the UK.

A New Theory on Mapping the New World
By Guy Gugliotta
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, October 7, 2002; Page A07
In 1507, a group of scholars working in France produced an extraordinary map
of the world, the first to put the still-recent discoveries of Columbus and
others into a new continent separate from Asia, and to call that continent
"America." With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.
But there was something else. What would later come to be called South
America and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the
east coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast
-- which no European was known to have seen.
The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of
modern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right
geographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed
along its top.
The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the
curvature of the Earth.
It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12
large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was
published six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus of
Panama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around the

A man has admitted making hoax calls to police investigating the
disappearance of Soham schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells.
Wrexham Magistrates Court, in North Wales, heard jobless Howard Youde made
three calls to police in Cambridgeshire claiming to have abducted the
He was arrested in Wrexham in the early hours of August 16 when officers
traced the call to a phone box on the town's Brook Street.
The 45-year-old, of Queensway, Hope, near Wrexham, has pleaded guilty to one
count of wasting police time on August 15 this year.
The court was told Youde claimed to have no recollection of making the calls
having been drinking all day.
Defence lawyer Mark Arden says the offence was neither premeditated nor
calculated but added that this was no excuse.
He said: "What he's done is horrific. It's unforgivable. The distress he's
caused the families is unacceptable."
Youde has been released on unconditional bail until November 7 when he will
be sentenced.
The hearing has been adjourned for pre-sentence reports although the
defendant has been warned custody is an option.

 Fake bank website cons victims
 West African criminals have used a fake version of a British bank's online
 service to milk victims of cash, say police. The fake site was used to squeeze
 more money out of people they had already hooked. 
 The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,
 (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being
 taken in by the fake website. 
 The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a
 share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African
 nations. 
 NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would
 otherwise spot the scam. 
 Convincing site 
 News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an
 unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out
 their victims. 
 A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had "the" in
 front of the bank's name. 
 "I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated," said the NCIS
 spokesman. "It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced
 online." 
 Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people
 behind it have not been caught. 
 NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. 
 The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many
 other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. 
 Domain games 
 Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or
 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any
 cash successfully moved out of Africa. 
 The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such
 crimes. 
 Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking
 the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe
 uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. 
 Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to
 it. 
 NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in
 London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. 
 Cutting edge fraud 
 Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of
 legitimacy. 
 People tricked into clicking on fake sites
 But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in
 place of the certificates. 
 "To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web
 technology," said the spokesman. 
 One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website
 that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African
 Reserve Bank, the country's national bank. 
 Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to
 visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has
 been deposited in their name. 
 But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically
 asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. 
 Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national
 priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. 
 Modern gloss 
 An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that
 criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give
 old cons a modern gloss. 
 The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come
 forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two
 months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. 
 He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be
 true, undoubtedly is. 
 One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment
 service Paypal. 
 Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account
 and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. 
 The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed
 people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use.

Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star.
Shot dead
Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New
York City apartment on 8 December 1980.
He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session
during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice.
Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from
Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as
Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him.
The killer said Lennon had been just "a picture on an album cover" to him
before the shooting.
'Deserved death'
Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his
Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if
Chapman were released.
Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the

have been 62 on Wednesday.

Evangelicals' threat to new archbishop
Direct action threat over liberal views on sexuality
Stephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian
Evangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust
Rowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takes
up his post, by threatening to take "direct action" against him.
The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest
evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,
which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his
supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.
Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met
the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his
appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.
The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to
destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded
with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.
Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has
ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who
have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new
archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the
Nevertheless, the society said: "It is clear that he prefers his private
judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the
common mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.
"The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan
Williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand
down," it said.
The society claimed to have drawn up an "action plan," including calling on
bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of
which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from
Dr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be
"taking steps towards appropriate direct action".
It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal
called Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles
allegedly commending homosexual behaviour.
Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the
church. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown
appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his
appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.
He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be
formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.
Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the
society's chairman, said: "Watch this space." Presumably it could involve a
small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking
alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams
is present.
Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down
during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the
evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the
absence of a robust rebuttal.
A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the
evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical
On the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of
Westcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption
and blackmail. "It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is
attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get
your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation," she said.
Last week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. "Matters of sexuality
should not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church
Society have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his
appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take
the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God."

Weevil pest warms to life in south-west London
James Meek, science correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian
They're chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancy
taste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they
are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants.
Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold
winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been
detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
"This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory," said
Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London
who discovered the creatures in the UK.
The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous
damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species,
otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known
north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. "It's very likely
these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental
plants from Italy," said Dr Barclay. "It looks like they're here to stay."
He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store
in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a
migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in
south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has
established itself firmly in the same area.
Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and
grape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The
soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.
One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of
Britain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a

Nobel Honors 3 for Astrophysics Work 
Tuesday October 8, 2002 12:00 PM
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Two Americans and a Japanese won the Nobel Prize in
physics Tuesday for using some of the most obscure particles and waves in
nature to understand the workings of astronomy's grandest wonders.
Riccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington,
D.C., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneering
contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic
Raymond Davis, Jr., 87, of the University of Pennsylvania shares the other
half of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, of the
University of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giant
underground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from
the sun by the billion.
Neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because
they are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.
In fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South
Dakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.
Koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino
detector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and
also discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of
the brightest objects in the universe.
The Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for
building the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and
sharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.
His research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the
discovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the
hearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.
When academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside
Washington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshiba
also was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach
Davis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.
This year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney
Brenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,
55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the
Karolinska Institute.
The researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ
growth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how
viruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as
AIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.
The winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday
morning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of
Alfred Nobel later the same day.
The literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the Swedish
Academy said on Tuesday.
The winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -
will be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.
The award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are
not publicly revealed for 50 years.
Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who
endowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.
In his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to
those who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and
``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field
of physics.''
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and
economics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts
in the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted
in strict secrecy.
The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in
1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.

Lioness adopts fifth antelope
Rory Carroll, Africa correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian
Kamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting
her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled
wildlife experts.
The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her
latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday.
Each time Kamuniak, whose name means "the blessed one" in the local Samburu
tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed
the natural mothers to feed them.
Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while
Kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by
their natural mothers.
The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari ("taken by
force"), was adopted at the weekend.
"She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony," said
Gabriel Lepariyo, a warden.
Naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a
Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak
is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are
cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour
and confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wants
to be loved.

Dracula theme park could be switched to Bucharest
A controversial scheme to build a Dracula theme park in Romania could be
switched away from Transylvania.
Consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers is now recommending that it be built in
Bucharest instead.
It comes after Prince Charles led international protests against the
original proposals to build it in the medieval town of Sigishoara.
PricewaterhouseCoopers name Bucharest, originally believed to be an outsider
in the race to host the park, as the most profitable location for the
But that has angered residents in Sigishoara, where Vlad the Impaler, the
inspiration for Dracula, was born. They are counting on the park to boost
the local economy.
Evenimentul Zilei reports that Sigishoara was placed behind the capital with
the Black Sea port of Constanta third choice.
Dorin Danesan, mayor of Sigishoara, said: "The pre-feasibility report from
PWC shows that the park would attract more tourists if it was located in
Bucharest. But I still think that Sigishoara is the best location for it."
The park would include hotels, a Dracula roller coaster, catacombs, a ghost
train and a house of horrors, as well as vampire dungeons located around a
reconstruction of Dracula's castle and an artificial lake.
The project has also been objected to by the world heritage organisation
Unesco fearing Sigishoara might be spoilt.
PricewaterhouseCoopers is to present its final report on the project on
October 15.

Newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture caption
Readers of an African newspaper have complained after a picture caption
about jewellery contained the words "let's have sex".
The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages
spoken in Namibia.
Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which
translates roughly as "let's have intercourse" in the Oshiwambo language.
It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings from
the femidon - female condom - as jewellery.
According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIV
patients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.
He intended it to mean "you will see for yourselves" in the Siyeyi tongue.
One caller said the complainants "should be considerate of other people's
languages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And
that the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo".
Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in various
Namibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in
Siyeyi means testicles.
Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo
translates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's have
The Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.

BUSH COVERS THE WATERFRONT
It may seem like all Iraq, all the time in the Oval Office, but
the president has at least one other thing on his mind this
week: that pesky port lockout. The freight still isn't moving,
factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and
retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing
day. 
On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to 
see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this 
isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one 
day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the
next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the
1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work
for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the
disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages.
Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or
safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao
covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work
stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew 
Iraq would be in here somewhere). "Union officials quickly
responded that their members have been unloading military cargo
throughout the 10-day shutdown," said the L.A. Times, but an
anonymous Bush administration official "said that only a portion 
of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore."
Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley
would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the
other hand, "Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the
increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in
polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political
danger to the Republican administration," said the San Francisco 
Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll
reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the 
economy. "Though the administration promised an unbiased
examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his
mind that it was hurting national security and the economy,
andmerited federal intervention," said the AP. 
As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor
disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers
simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case).
One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers'
contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78
days until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen Muehlbauer

THE BIGGEST CABLE HOOKUP
wo birds want to join forces and the FCC is about to cry "fowl." 
We mean "foul." The two dominant direct broadcast satellite
players want to join forces, the better to compete with Big
Cable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice
Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of
DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite 
service in the US.
The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed
merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- 
it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and
$25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as 
some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents,
and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV
and EchoStar is Dish. All straight?
The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold
off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice
Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified
"major revisions" to the deal that they want to discuss with
Justice in the next weeks.
The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those
revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies
to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted 
to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the 
cable company's plans and past spending on such a project.
TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for
investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for
expanded-service television may be nearing saturation.
TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded,
"Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but
shareholders may realize much smaller returns."
The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch 
waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid for
DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar. If the
current deal falls through, he'll be back. - Keith Dawson

I'm surprised to not find this phenomenon in Corlis. I could have sworn I
saw it there. He does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow
and a secondary bow. I personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a
semi-circle of darker sky.
I know I've read about pillars under the Sun and Moon elsewhere, but I can't
recall if they were reportedly dark or bright. I do know these sorts of
things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system. I'm
sorry I haven't got any answers, but a search through some books on
atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up.

trying to escape.  Several times he seems to have escaped and the british

This is a good point. There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon
products derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as
a replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -
there is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,
but this is to replicate materials that have been previously created 
much more easily within the petrochemical industry.
Vegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower
oil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world 
war, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from
waste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. 
Jay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as 
petroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication 
of the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously
being developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately 
matching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock
oil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the
gap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to 
cope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.
My big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.
Re-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals
(that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely 
difficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the
petrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect
that, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,
just at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,
for example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.
All we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling
like pig farms and fish and chip shops...

Cambodia temple ruins yield treasure
Workers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda in
northern Cambodia have unearthed 31 Buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold.
The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good
condition and believed to be hundreds of years old.
They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich temple
about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.
The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn down
during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area became
Community care
Deputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues
- three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre
(3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb).
''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago,
when the last temple was fully operating," Mr Hang Sithim said.
Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby
town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at the
temple to take care of them.
''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor of
Kampong Thom province.
''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''
Reign of terror

Britons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in Europe
John Carvel, social affairs editor
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian
Not every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According
to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,
shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.
The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of
anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the
University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit
people's shape.
The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the
inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below
the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.
It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)
taller than his French counterpart.
The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men
only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height
advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.
The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared
with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and
1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and
Americans 1,626.7mm
More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other
nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men
and 66.7 for women.
The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7
inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and
806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of
The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second
largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably
smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.
The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than
the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the
Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively
outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.
However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm
compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,
compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.
The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the
available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm
longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American
The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German
counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.
Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for
occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.
The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to
open ring pull cans.

 Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham
 or sick of Sheffield.
 Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey
 this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps
 heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.
 Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied
 with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to
 emigrate to provincial Russia.
 After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek
 article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other
 side.
 "The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city
 deep in the provinces where things are quiet," said Kommersant.
 "In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly
 cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are
 becoming 'traditionally' relaxed."
 The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of
 tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.
 It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the
 famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also
 opening time in the nation's vodka shops.
 And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that
 "the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be
 enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their
 life.
 "The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle
 of whisky for kopecks."
 There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a
 halfpenny in sterling.
 The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton
 will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine
 vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among
 diehard alcoholics.
 While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The
 newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail
 soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British
 settler should overcome the difficulty.
 "For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut
 off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle."
 One or two potential emigrés might be deterred by language difficulties. There
 are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the
 Mongolian border.
 However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a
 deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in
 which they would like to live.
 France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country "where English is only known
 by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists".
 Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian
 weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.
 Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.
 And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place
 in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures
 that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the
 permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.
 Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the
 climatic problems, it said that "thanks to global warming this difficulty will
 solve itself".
 Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in
 Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.
 "Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33
 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found
 amongst our citizens."
 Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons
 surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their
 preferred new home.

 Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected 
 By Bruce Johnston in Rome
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's
 traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six
 people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.
 Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena 
 Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio
 nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine,
 contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.
 Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take
 part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the
 off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.
 Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa
 did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.
 As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his
 mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.
 Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,
 was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.
 Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police
 yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers
 from video footage.
 Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as
 contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact
 that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.
 The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on
 the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade
 through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.
 But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.
 The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary
 undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last
 minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not
 grab their reins.
 The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'
 boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend
 Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.
 The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles
 of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of
 the Assumption of the Virgin.

Hamza's horrid - but we must tolerate him
Rod Liddle
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian
Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman
to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing
with his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.
I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on
statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the
way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the
sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,
and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen
for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and
maybe me and you, too.
But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the
Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded
happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic
proto-warriors in the background.
You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily
Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye
covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't
mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom
we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come
off. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the
British right) as "Captain Hook", in articles which usually call for his
arrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe
off to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and
thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if
we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him
to shut up.
Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before
September 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all
thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political
And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've
got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory
manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of
context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But
perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and
tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's
Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier
this year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his
allegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were
meant to do stuff like that.
He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been
frozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the
media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations
and the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly
- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be
true - Hamza is not "representative" of British Muslims, as if British
Muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could
turn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.
The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was
revealed to be rather more "representative" than the list of those
government-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -
dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism
and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.
An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an
overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.
One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US
(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought
the war against terrorism was a war against Islam.
Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the
time, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at
home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from
the liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US
foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action
against Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.
Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't
suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,
the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful
for the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.
Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has
been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more
inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His
ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be
happy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for
example. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly
And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire
to be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful
appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the
ruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.
Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that
are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.
The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing
remotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution
is simply the pungency of his views.
It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his
rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This
is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.
You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And
if British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of
unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is
not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man
up, therefore, won't make a difference.
It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:
The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.
But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.

Pro-hunt activists target top sight
ONE of Yorkshire's most famous sights yesterday became one of the first
targets in bizarre attacks on White Horse landmarks linked to the hunting
Villagers near Thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday
to find the famous White Horse of Kilburn had acquired a rider during the
In another incident, the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire had a huntsman
and three hounds added to the ancient figure, which is thought to represent
a Celtic god or tribal symbol.
Pro-hunt activists in the Real Countryside Alliance (RCA) ­ a radical
alternative to the better-known Countryside Alliance ­ admitted
responsibility last night for targeting the two images.
The 314ft by 228ft landmark at Kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it
was carved in the limestone by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils in
But during Monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman
with a horn ­ which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white
carpet. It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse
Association, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.
John Roberts of the association said: "It has obviously been very well
organised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a
horn cut out of carpets.
"It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it
to bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings
to be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will
not get another refit for another year.
"Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle ­ a tractor and trailer or a
lorry ­ because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely
well planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off."
The sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south
of England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs
Mr Roberts added: "The damage as such is not great but it adds to the
deterioration, which means it will need more work next time.
"We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to
take it away again because it was a major job."
Andy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:
"It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud
of it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful
consideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of
vegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There
has not been a cut in the turf ­ which would be much more of a problem. It
would seem it was carefully plotted beforehand."
An RCA spokesman said: "Some people in the country are getting very
frustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches
don't seem to be doing anything good."
The Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.
Spokesman Adrian Yelland said: "The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates
campaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and
regrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident."
The incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in
Yorkshire thought to be RCA work.

 It's August, and big cats are on the prowl
 By Alan Hamilton
 ROUND up the sheep. Pull on the gauntlets. Oil the shotgun. The British
 countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big,
 vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday,
 including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair
 samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its
 undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike. 
 Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping,
 founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has
 received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. 
 “During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat
 activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from
 the public has been fantastic,” Mr Bamping said. “Big cats in Britain are
 real. They are out there, they are breeding; there’s more of them.” 
 Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark
 Fraser, who heads the society’s Scottish arm, said: “Lynx are now present in
 the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I don’t
 want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several
 hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders.” 
 Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which
 includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as
 well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in
 Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand
 was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black
 hairy tufts on the tips of its ears. 
 The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of
 trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the
 beasts, which it will then present to the Government. 
 It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all.
 Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start. 
 Next in August: record abductions by aliens.

Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two 
images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, "to keep the pro-hunt

Aerial shots show the 374ft-long Bronze Age image on the Berkshire Downs 
near Uffington in Oxfordshire complete with three white hounds and a rider.
In North Yorkshire, a rider in full hunt regalia has been added to the 300ft 
White Horse cut in to the hills at Kilburn, which dates back to the 1700s.
But no-one reported anything to the police.
A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said no reports had been received but 
he had seen "a red blob" on the horse and had sent officers to investigate.
In Uffington, no-one in the village had heard anything about the reported 
incident. A spokesman for Thames Valley police said he was not aware of any 
Activists say the image in Oxfordshire was drawn in paint used for marking 
lines on grass tennis courts and will wash away in the first rains.

money.  For example, I could copy a Gibson Guitar /exactly/ so long as
(a) I don't put Orville's name on the headstock and (b) I license the
patented bracing methods.  If I instead try to sell a homebuilt guitar
on eBay with "Gibson" written in crayon on the headstock, and then
claim it is a true Les Paul limited edition, I expect people would get
it is about granting endless and cascading duplication/distribution
rights.  Even if _I_ only make the copy I give to you, that doesn't
stop you from making 10000 copies to sell.
This is the difficult question:  How will they draw the distinction?
The "other stuff" is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff.
This is why MS is hunting people with illegal Windows; it's no harder
to dup than a Linux CD, only what is there that actually prevents
people from doing it?
Personally, I don't think the issue should have anything to do with
sales or units.  The issue is that basic phallacy that says a suit
should be able to "own" someone else's intellectual property.  Sarah
McLaughlin isn't suing you, it's her label's legal dept because it's
the label who stands to lose; Sarah's already fat beyond her wildest
dreams, so a few bucks here or there, or even if the well dried up
tomorrow, it's not going to really traumatize her (unless she's been
blazingly stupid with her money)
But the label ... like Disney and Mickey, they need the cash cow so
they can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers-on in limos and coke.
If you thought only Elvis or Brian Jones or Dennis Wilson had problems
with beautiful-people deadbeat leech "friends" draining their riches,
think again.
The problem is really very simple because it is semantic, and until we
make the semantic flip, it's unsolvable, but like trisecting an angle,
all it takes is looking at the same situation in a different
way.  Here's the revelation: Elvis never ever made a hit record.
Elvis didn't make the hits, his /fans/ made the hits.  His fans did
the work cleaning toilets, manning the convenience stores, driving
milk trucks, sitting at endless office desks, they did the /real/
labour that paid for every last one of Elvis Presley's pills.  All
Elvis did was sing into a microphone every so often, and pen or
collect the odd song that all those /people/ liked and wanted as
something of their own.  But it's not _Elvis_ who made them universal
statements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs into
their own lives, it was pull-technology, not push.
Therefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans pay
before they own what they themselves have created?  They pay royalties
for listening to the radio, for blank tapes, for concert tickets, for
a beer in a bar with a cover band ... they pay over and over and over
again for the /right/ to make some hack writer's song /their/
favourite song????  That's where the whole system has been seriously
warped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into your
thinking that it is the Elvis who makes the Elvis.  It's not.  It's
the people who make them; the songs are already theirs.

(for those not yet de-jobbed) is the art of getting past the HR-stage
interview and into the engineer-to-engineer interview.  HR is not
being honest with you so there's no ethical quandry to be totally
honest with them: If they want experience numbers that would place you
in the OAK project, lead them to believe that you have "something
roughly equivalent" (ie "it wasn't 5 years, but it was three intense
years with plenty of overtime") -- they are playing a bluff in saying
/they/ know the job requirements so you're perfectly within poker
rules to bluff back to say you have it.
If you /don't/ have the requisite Right Stuff, the engineers can
usually suss it out pretty fast during the second interview.  Most
often, their choice is based 90% on "who can I work with" and only
maybe 10% on "how much/little will we have to tutor this candidate?"

Dell Latitude CPx laptop that I've got. Does anyone know any way to enable this,
for example through the use of a special cable for the Modular Bay (where CD-ROM
or floppy drive is normally).
There is also the possibility of using a docking station, but Dell's docking
solution for the Latitude series doesn't seem to allow for the use of an IDE
drive, only SCSI... Unless someone knows of a "non-Dell" solution that's
Anyone any ideas?

Ok, Iknow this is blatantly OT but I'm beginning to go insane.
Had an old Dell Dimension XPS sitting in the corner and decided to
put it to use, I know it was working pre being stuck in the
corner, but when I plugged it in, hit the power nothing happened.
I opened her up and had a look and say nothing much. A little orange
LED comes on when I plug her in but that's it, after some googling
I found some reference to re-seating all the parts, but no change.
The problem I'm having is that since the power supply is some Dell
specific one, ATX block with what looks like one of the old AT
power connectors, I cant figure out weather this is a Mobo prob
or a PSU prob. Just to futily try and drag this back OT, I want
to install Linux on it when I get it working. If anyone knows
what the problem might be give me a shout.

Here is what you do.
Remove all the PCI & ISA/EISA cards.
Remove the floppy disk cable from the mobo, the ide cables from the mobo...
essentially leaving only a video card... ram and a keyboard plugged in.
Turn on the system.
If it doesn't POST then, switch it off and remove the video card.
Switch it back on ... if your mobo doesn't emit some beeps complaining about
lack of video card then.
Switch it off.
Remove it's ram.
Same procedure as above.
If you still don't have any kind of mobo beep codes then you can try as a
last ditch effort to reseat the cpu... (remembering to never ever ever power
up your system without a heatsink & fan).
If after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes,
from it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa cards or and
no actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you
have power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu.
Once you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually
disjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of POST.

Hello folks!
I'm new to Linux, so here goes...
I've been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem.
I've got Debian with kernel 2.4.18.
I've got this Win-Modem(yes, I know) and managed to locate a proper driver
for it.
Minicom is very much able to dial out.
But there seems to be a problem with my PPPD installation.
When I type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal, all I get (after the initial info
of my dynamic IP, etc) is a ~ and then the NO CARRIER signal.
Then I looked into calling pppd directly using chat.
I used this command:  pppd call Provider (where Provider is some script
It dials, it connects, it sends my username & password, and when connection
is established, it gives the SIGHUP signal and exits.
This is confirmed when me friend and I tried to connect through a serial
port using pppd to connect ttyS0.  I ran pppd waiting for a connection, me
friend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited.
Some expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired of
having to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back to
Linux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc.  It'd be nice never have
to go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).
Thanks a million.

Hi all,
I've decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result is
that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually
testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality
people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from
that, right? ;-)
I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages
should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and
maybe others, who knows ;-)
Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :
- Recompile the "alsa-driver" source rpm for your running kernel
  (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)
- Install this "alsa-driver" package
- Install the "alsa-libs" package
- Install the "alsa-utils" package
Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your
/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :
(very complete and very good documentation!)
Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)
Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need
to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) "by hand" and
insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! ("dmesg" to
check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with
e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.
With "aplay" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You
can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...
hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3
files... that's it!
It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only
thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't
imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the
/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly
%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d
structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the
default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's
development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static
libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against
which the "alsa-driver" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the
rpm release, so does the architecture!).
I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!

PS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply
run "xine -A alsa09" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)

While I was playing with the past issues, it annoyed me that there was
no easy way to make the log stop growing (I don't mean to truncate it,
I mean to just freeze it for a while).
The following patch adds a new button to the log window, which allows
the log to be switched on/off (the button says "Disable" when the
log is enabled, and the button disables it, and "Enable" when the log
is frozen, and the button enables it again).

LIMA, Peru (Reuters) -- Lina Medina's parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru's Andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital. 
Just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. 
Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. 
At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as "Little Chicago." 
Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. 
But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. 
"The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care," Jose Sandoval, author of "Mother Aged 5," told Reuters. 
"We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective," he added. 
'Totally willing to help'
Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. 
"We're totally willing to help her," said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. 
Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. "She got no help (in 1939) that I know about," he said. "She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true." 
Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. 
Medical rarity
No one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. 
One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. 
He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. 
Her swelling stomach worried her parents. "They thought it was a tumor," he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. 
There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. 
Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. 
Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. 
More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. 
One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. 
But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in "moral danger," and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. 
But Sandoval said: "It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them." 
Happy ending?
Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. 
Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. 
After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. 
He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. 
Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. 
She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. "We just want to get on with our lives, that's it," said Jurado, adding he thought "absolutely nothing" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. 
He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. 
He said its value was "more or less $25,000" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. 
As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. "I believe there will be a happy ending," he said. 
"As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era
of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the
country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the
prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands
and the Republic is destroyed."

2.5ft lizard 'abandoned' at resort
Holidaymakers at a seaside resort were stunned to find a 2.5ft lizard
sunning itself at a caravan park close to a beach.
The savannah monitor lizard was captured at Chapel St Leonards, Lincs, on
Sunday by a member of the public before being collected by an RSPCA team.
RSPCA officer Justin Stubbs, who took the lizard to a specialist carer,
said: "Savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldn't
have wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long."
Officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private owner
because it has not been reported missing.
Savannah monitor lizards originate in Africa and are carnivorous, eating
rats and small rodents. They can grow to 4ft in length.
Anyone with information about the lizard can contact the RSPCA in confidence
on 08705 555 999.

Close encounter of burnt kind
IT came from outer space ­ or did it? Teenager Siobhan Cowton is convinced
the object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her home
in Northallerton is extra-terrestrial.
But while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studied
academic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirl
is adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite.
Siobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation ­ that the
odd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,.
But on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed ­ because
it was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury.
"I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble
surface," she said.
After closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures on
the Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to check
the object for authenticity.
If it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up for
She added: "If it isn't worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myself
for sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite."
But Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of
academic caution.
"Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece
of extraterrestrial rock," he said.
"They have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressions
and cavities. If they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burnt
around the edge.
"Most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is the
smallest that they usually appear."
to be subject to a mineral breakdown but Dr Horton thinks the chances of it
being extra-terrestrial are slim.
"Around 50,000 a year strike the Earth's surface and, considering the size
of the Earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite.
"However, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn't happen,"
he added.

 'Lost' penguins found alive
 by Charles Miranda
 A colony of emperor penguins which was thought to have starved to death in
 Antarctica has been found alive in a "big huddle". 
 The birds were spotted by the crew of a USAF jet returning to base in New
 Zealand. Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica
 had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. 
 Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made
 it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in
 October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: "The
 penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a
 successful breeding season over the winter." 
 Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall
 and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research
 station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the
 cape, may have lost up to third of its population.

Big cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards record
numbers, a monitoring group has claimed. 
The British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports of
animals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigers
over the past 12 months. 
And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the
average moggy, it claims to have "firm evidence" that the majority are real.
Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with the
critics and doubters, adding: "I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the same
realm as the Loch Ness monster. 
"But it's not, they are really out there." 
'Cats with cubs' 
Mr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the
country. 
Big cat reports  
Hotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire 
January 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx 
November 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat 
April 2001 - Lynx captured in north London 
1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales  
"This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders,
Kent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire," he said. 
The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. 
But Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in
sufficient numbers to breed among themselves. 
"We have had sightings of cats with cubs," he added. 
'Trigger camera' 
The society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, including
photographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. 
But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public
that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. 
A national "trigger camera" project is planned which, the society hopes,
will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. 
Mr Bamping said: "The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and
take a picture of itself." 
'Like dogs' 
The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the
wild, or their descendants. 
Its spokesman Danny Nineham said: "In the 1960s and 1970s, people had big
cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. 
"But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, people
released their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put them
down, or take them to a zoo."

US soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portable
translation device will be an essential part of their equipment. 
Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a prototype of a
speech translator that was road-tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. 
"This project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translation
system can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools,"
said the team from Carnegie Mellon University in a research paper published
recently. 
The research was commissioned by the US Army, which is increasingly finding
itself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key. 
Speaking in tongues 
"In the Balkans, the Army is not just supposed to conquer somebody," Robert
Frederking of Carnegie Mellon University told the BBC programme Go Digital. 
Translators could be essential for US soldiers
"In a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other up
and you are holding them apart. 
"You can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on and
talk to them," he said. 
The portable translator was developed with a year, using commercially
available laptops. 
The Army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation.
So instead the translator was tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. 
"The chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals and
typically don't have any translation support," explained Mr Frederking. 
Slow system 
For the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to Croatians who
knew just a smattering of English. 
The system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words in
Croatian, turns the speech into text. The written words are then translated
into English and read out by a speech synthesizer. 
"It went reasonably well half the time," said Mr Frederking, though it was
slow in translating phrases. 
The research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the
field. 
But they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to
work with further research and development. 
The Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between
the US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon
University.

Ananova:  
Brazilian bees keep their own 'insect ranch'
Scientists have found a new species of bee that behaves like a farmer by
keeping herds of insects.
The Amazonian Schwarzula use their own 'insect ranches' to provide food and
building materials.
The bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from a
species called cryptostigma.
Cryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the bees
stop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey.
The insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the bees
scrape off and use for their nest.
Nature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered in
Biologist Joao Camargo, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: "In
turn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection."
Writing in the journal Biotropica, Camargo says the bees might even carry
their insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning further
research on how they tend to their herd.
Studies of the Schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugar
from the insect farms. Some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt.

Not fortean, but a moment in time all the same...
Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after
losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. 
Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000
more machines for the Japanese market. 
They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998. 
VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s
Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better
quality than its VHS rival. 
Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,
1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the
film rental industry and in homes. 
Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. 
"With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the
market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to
secure parts," Sony said in a statement. 
Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the
format. 
The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the
television and film industries and will be unaffected. 
But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin
for Betamax home players. 
In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. 
Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of
competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. 
The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,
although VHS tapes had a longer duration. 
A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no
new ones will be made after the end of 2002. 
Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

Zimbabwe eases GM stance
Zimbabwe has dropped objections to accepting genetically modified (GM) grain
so that urgently-needed food aid can be delivered, says the UN food agency.
The executive director of the World Food Programme, James Morris, said
Zimbabwe's decision would send an important message to other countries in
the region which have refused food aid because it might contain GM grain.
Until now, Zimbabwe had said it would only allow aid workers to distribute
ground maize to allay fears that GM grain could be planted.

There have been fears that Southern African nations could lose lucrative

Mr Morris announced the policy reversal after talks in Harare with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.
"The fact that they have now concluded that they are comfortable in
accepting GM crops or commodities will be an important signal to other
countries in the region," Mr Morris told journalists.
"It will enable us to do our job," he said.
Aid workers say up to 13 million people in seven countries in Southern
Africa face famine. In Zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the
region, some six million people are estimated to need food aid.
The WFP says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnes
of food it intends to bring into Zimbabwe in the next few months.
The government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government's
campaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has
worsened the situation, say many donors.
Lost markets
The GM row has complicated relief efforts across the region.
Zambia's president is refusing to overturn his ban on GM food aid, labelling
it as 'poison' .
Deals to mill GM food before being distributed, so that it could not be
planted, have placated fears in Malawi and Mozambique.
United States aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out that
Americans eat GM maize every day.
The World Health Organisation has certified the grain for human consumption
and says it does not constitute a danger to people's health.

Near the end of his *Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the
Madness of Crowds* (1851), Charles Mackay discusses various catch phrases
briefly popular in mid-19th-century London. One of them, he observes,
"like a mushroom, seems to have sprung up in the night, or, like a frog in
Cheapside, to have come down in a sudden shower. One day it was unheard,
unknown, uninvented; the next it pervaded London."
Was "like a frog in Cheapside" (or something similar) a catch phrase
itself, or did Mackay come up with the simile on his own?
And to what event or events does it refer?

 Scissors are a snip for Third World
 From Richard Owen in Rome
 IT IS one of the unanswered questions of the past year: what happens to the
 millions of nail scissors confiscated by airport security officials from
 passengers’ hand luggage? Most are thrown away or recycled after being seized
 as part of security measures since September 11. But an enterprising chaplain
 is sending them to Catholic missionaries for distribution to Third World
 hospitals and clinics. In theory travellers who have left nail scissors, nail
 files, corkscrews or manicure sets from their hand luggage can arrange for
 them to be returned. In practice many just shrug and leave the scissors by the
 X-ray scanners. 
 Father Arturo Rossini, chaplain of Malpensa airport in Milan, said that
 scissors were costly or unavailable in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin
 America. 
 He told Corriere della Sera that he had “plucked up the courage” to ask the
 authorities if he could have the confiscated scissors. With the help of a
 retired airport policeman, he had packaged 60,000 nail scissors and manicure
 sets, using the airport chapel as a packing centre. 
 Packages were shipped in aircraft holds to Peru, Brasil, India, Mozambique,
 Argentina, Zambia and Kenya. “In such countries, what we think of as a
 personal grooming accessory can be a vital tool.” 
 The idea has been taken up at other Italian airports.

No, that would be rather silly. There are conflicting reports on whether
Zambia is prepared to accept milled GM grain or not - and, from reports from
various sources, considerable debate within that country. There's complex
issues, not all of which can be dismissed by blaming those nasty
environmentalists, which was my original point.

 Hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties
 By Roger Boyes
 MANAGERS of Germany’s political parties are having difficulty explaining their
 enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed
 largely from Mein Kampf, Hitler’s personal manifesto. The incident illustrates
 how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an
 election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to
 those of the Führer. 
 “Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the
 present Chancellor,” said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union
 headquarters in Ingolstadt. “Chancellor Schröder is doing nothing to stop the
 flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland,” said the letter,
 signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald. 
 The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. “Many thanks for your nice
 thoughts,” replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for
 membership. 
 The letter used chunks of Hitler’s book, which is still banned in Germany.
 History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries.
 “The strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of
 existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive,”
 the letter-writer said. “So-called humanity is melting like snow in the March
 sun.” Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf, which was written while Hitler
 was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923. 
 Similar letters, also using the Nazi leader’s words, were sent to the other
 political parties and drew sympathetic responses. “I read your letter with
 great interest and pleasure,” the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in
 Cologne, said. 
 “Great that you want to join us!” enthused the Green Party headquarters. The
 Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball
 at which Hans- Dietrich Genscher, the former Foreign Minister, would be the
 star guest. The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by
 Gerhard Schröder, the Chancellor. 
 “I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing
 extremism,” said the letter-writer, who was in fact the Cologne novelist
 Rainer Popp. “I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic. 
 “For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special
 Branch to knock on my door. Instead only the postman called — with packets of
 election material from zealous political headquarters,” Herr Popp said. 
 “I was stunned that political parties could react in this way — I reckon I
 would have had the same response if I had signed the letter ‘Adolf Hitler’.”

Normally, I find it sufficient to put --prefix=/usr/local, and do not

Maybe you have a special reason for using the prefixes you chose, in

I'd make the same remarks about prefixes here.  I would use the command
    ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local
    --with-url=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/
(Assuming you compiled/installed url with --prefix=/usr/local
Since you appear to have installed url in /url/url, configure w3 with
./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/ --with-url=/url/url/share/emacs/site-lisp
A command you would have found useful would have been
    find / -name 'url-vars.el' -print
Which would have told you where the url-vars.el file was installed.
A program which is very useful is checkinstall
It allows you to install packages from source while still registering
them in the package management system of your distro (rpm,deb,tgz).
Instead of "make install" type "checkinstall", and a package is put
together and installed for you.  Makes uninstallation simpler than it
might otherwise be.

Hello all,
Firstly I'd like to thank all of you for the fast and very helpful feedback
that I got to my question today.  I have one more question though.  I
downloaded the w3 and url files from the server at the first try thanks to
the help that I received today.  Then though I tried to build them.  I
started by trying the w3 program.  I used the following lines which produced
some strange results.  Would any one be able to set me straight?
./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/
local/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/url
That worked fine so I moved to the next step.
At the bottem of the text I got the following messages:
Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el
make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp'
make: *** [w3] Error 2
When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.  In saying
that this doesn't necessarily mean that I was doing it right so below are
the commands I used.
./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url
followed by the commands make and make install.
There is no text files which contain help on installing the url package so
I'm not completely certain if I've used the right method here.
Thanks again

Hello again. I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at the end of it, everything still goes smoothly until I type "make" after I get the output from the ./configure. 
However, there were a couple of things I noticed along the way. After typing 
* make oldconfig
* make dep
The 2nd to last line I got back said that the modversions.h file was not updated. When I looked at this path to the modversions.h file, it was 281 lines and every line started with a # mark. Is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a # mark (or am I just thinking of another language?) and so should I delete the # at certain places?
Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed "make", I noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h file. Inside this other file, there's nothing at all. And so I moved the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file - and got a different reply after "make". The output after I moved the file over mostly looked like this:
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33: linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37: linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36: linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directory
The odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file) that I'd have to compile/make?
It's taken plenty of elbow grease, but I'm glad it hasn't gone smoothly, it's a good learning experience. Again, any help is appreciated. Thanks, Eric

Regarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel
software to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. 
I recall from your previous mail that there was a flag
    --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4
which could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate
directory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you to
persuade the code to compile against the correct headers.  I think this
is the right way to proceed.
Alternatively, maybe the steps above regarding "make dep" and so forth
should have been performed in the directory where the make process is
looking for modversions.h & Co.
I don't think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as
you describe below.  First of all you will move modversions.h (which you
have done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after
that, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h)
files.  This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those files
don't really belong there).

Hi All,
I have a question which is a bit tricky and was
wondering of anyone has come across this problem
before or could point me in the right direction.
I am involved in porting a SCO unix application to
Linux, and we have encountered a problem with the way
semaphores  are being handled. The application uses
mulitple processes to run application code with the
main process known as the bsh which controls all i/o
be it screen, or file i/o, syncronisation is handled
via semaphores.
In certain circumstances the main process and the
application child process seem to lock up both waiting
for the syncronisation semaphores to change state, I
have attached ddd to the processes and it seems that
the semaphore code is doing the correct things for
syncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the
semop() system call.
I have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delay
between changing semaphore states the problem goes
away, but this causes our entire application to run
really sloooww !! lol
Is there anything weird or different with the standard
implemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could
cause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in state
in a semaphore immediately?
Setting sem_flg = IPC_NOWAIT and checking for errno ==
EAGAIN and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails
(-1) also fixes the problem but again system
performance goes down the toilet.
both the parent controlling process run as the same
uid, and the parent creates the semaphores with
permissions 0666.
Any pointers would be appreciated!

The Disappearing Alliance
By Dale Franks 10/08/2002
For over two generations, the countries of Western Europe have been our
closest allies. We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the
Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We
celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation
of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.
Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.
Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that
Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed "progressive
transnationalism". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist
progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the
deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of
citizenship (i.e. a "global" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and
the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the
United Nations.
The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the
pooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there
is a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected
European Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits
to their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where
elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an
appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,
whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,
the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of
the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired
by the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice
regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member
governments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development.
European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of
complaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact
that our republican system of government is not based on proportional
representation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise
the fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy
is so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear
- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere
in the world.
On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independent
newspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be
restrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade
or so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it
exaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because
the impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of
the US literally fantastic.
At least, for now.
Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact
remains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European
intellectual and political elite.
The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in
check the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a
system in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America,
however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot
understand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national
sovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it
does on compliance with international "norms." They view all departures
from such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal
vote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the
process is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble
with this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,
authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic
societies. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.
Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals
to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the
liberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its
dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references
to the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to
comply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,
therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a
commitment to
constitutional rights.
None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or
cooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in
favor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while
their tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a
political atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably
That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the
thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the
new ideology of transnational progressivism.

Given current trends, particularly in demographics, such conflict won't
be military.  Europe wouldn't stand a chance now and things are getting
worse in a hurry.  They are SOL.
Not to mention that when push comes to shove they wouldn't stand united.
Now that is a scary thought.

THE CHAIRMAN	
by NICHOLAS LEMANN
He's the other Powell, and no one is sure what he's up to.
New Yorker, October 8, 2002
Last year, my middle son, in eighth grade and encountering his first 
fairly serious American-history course, indignantly reported that the 
whole subject was incomprehensible. I was shocked. What about Gettysburg 
and the Declaration of Independence and the Selma-to-Montgomery march? 
Just look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His 
class had got up to the eighteen-forties. What I expected was a big 
beefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks, and, in-deed, 
there was some of that. But the main difference between my son's text 
and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous 
decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American 
history. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and 
reciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping 
for easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation 
of freight rates. Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it 
become possible to see the federal government's main function as 
responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, 
instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic 
Even now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty 
speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you'd find 
is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so 
much over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real 
estate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which 
this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and 
commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It's 
an insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because 
the public and the press—encouraged by the players, who speak in jargon—
can't get themselves interested.
One corner of Washington might be called F.C.C. World, for the Federal 
Communications Commission. F.C.C. World has perhaps five thousand 
denizens. They work at the commission itself, at the House and Senate 
commerce committees, and at the Washington offices of the companies that 
the commission regulates. They read Communications Daily (subscription 
price: $3,695 a year), and every year around Christmastime they 
grumblingly attend the Chairman's Dinner, at a Washington hotel, where 
the high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating 
comedy routine by the commission's chairman.
Of all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that 
Americans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with 
a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the 
American economy, as well as important aspects of daily life—telephone 
and television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now 
F.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, 
because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the 
"corporate scandals" concerns the economic collapse of companies 
regulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, 
among others, are (or were) part of F.C.C. World. AOL Time Warner is 
part of F.C.C. World. Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney 
analyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the 
embodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the 
past two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions 
of dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a 
dead weight pulling down the entire stock market.
This year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state 
of the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes 
F.C.C. World's feverish mood ("The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns") 
and suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of 
the commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I 
just quoted is followed by this explanation: "The ILECs appear likely to 
enter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no 
residential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% 
market share loss in business lines to CLECs." It's a lot easier to 
think about evil C.E.O.s than to decipher that.
Even in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the 
commission's chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially 
intense; and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes 
itself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael 
Powell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, 
because he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. 
Unlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which 
generates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about 
who he really is and what he's really up to. Powell is young to be the 
head of a federal agency—he is thirty-nine—and genially charming. 
Everybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years 
one of the F.C.C.'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the 
F.C.C.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the 
arcane details of communications policy. He's always saying that he's an 
"avid moderate." And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his 
predecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell 
to Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, 
calls him "radical and extreme." Just as often as he's accused of being 
a right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically 
cautious. "It ain't about singing 'Kum-Ba-Yah' around the campfire," 
another former chairman, William Kennard, says. "You have to have an 
answer." One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate 
subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the 
subcommittee's chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated 
him. "You don't care about these regulations," Hollings said. "You don't 
care about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That's the 
fundamental. That's the misgiving I have of your administration over 
there. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and 
seem to not care at all. I think you'd be a wonderful executive 
vice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a 
regulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your 
"Extremely," Powell said, with an amiable smile.
One cannot understand Powell's maddening effect, at least on Democrats 
and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose 
of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was 
created by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the 
New Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy 
cases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure 
that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its 
other original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, 
the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers 
unfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, 
well-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial 
supervision—its real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition 
among communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by 
artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. 
In addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission 
more specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many 
of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most 
terrifying category of interest group—you can cross the local bank 
president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. 
According to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once 
blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers 
in the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the 
anti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV 
station in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.
F.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, 
because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic 
niches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful 
breakup of A.T. & T.—by far the biggest and most important company the 
commission regulated—deposited a thick additional sediment of 
self-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation 
ago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one 
long-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, 
which customers were not permitted to own—and they were all the same 
company. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the 
mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local 
phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing 
to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores 
everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers—and 
millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the 
telephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a "natural 
monopoly," requiring protection from economic competition and total 
control over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, 
the F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones 
and the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: 
consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more 
prosperous, too.
The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 
one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which 
most people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. 
Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of 
modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group 
bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers 
as "baby Bells" and to F.C.C. World as "arbocks" (the pronounced version 
of RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to 
offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance 
companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for 
customers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would 
get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more 
competition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and 
economics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by 
Vice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as 
helping to reposition them as the technology party—the party that 
brought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of 
jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose 
beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. Clinton's 
slogans about the "information superhighway" and "building a bridge to 
the twenty-first century," which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully 
sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical 
correlates of the Telecom Act, and Gore's cruise to the Presidency was 
supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.
The F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, 
aggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like 
all important interest groups they work with both parties); they 
immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new 
competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through 
rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by 
Reed Hundt, who was Gore's classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep 
the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies 
like A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new 
companies, "see-lecks" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive 
local exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory 
equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have 
access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the 
seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the 
F.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.
Partly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that 
he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming 
condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the 
see-lecks—companies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligent—and 
into other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related 
technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom 
boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks 
and other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests 
of the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt's 
former lieutenants told me, "Reed used to joke that my job was to make 
sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up."
The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the 
boom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more 
startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: 
Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and 
Comcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys 
believed that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative 
accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so 
By the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been 
determined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the 
chairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of 
influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. 
Three Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; 
Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and 
Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as 
such, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most 
powerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of 
S.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant 
that the arbocks didn't want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he 
might be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he 
wasn't as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative 
movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than 
Powell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared 
before a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and 
gave a very Michael Powell speech—whimsical, intellectual, and 
free-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore's Law)—that 
began by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new 
telecom companies alive. "In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is 
often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas," Powell said. "Like the 
Whos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast 
beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the 
deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act's 
fertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the 
least, so it is thought." Thus Powell was indicating that if he became 
chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as 
part of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day 
of the Bush Administration.
Twenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead 
or dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in 
serious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite 
companies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically 
concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing 
companies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in 
good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged 
companies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the 
financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications 
industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells 
wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and 
if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national 
duopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. 
And these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the 
poor health of the long-distance companies.
The cable business also seems close to having two dominant national 
companies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they 
don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more 
fully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. As part 
of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 
Telecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were 
significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of 
radio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five 
per cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news 
programming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary 
of Viacom.
In this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should 
be hyperactive—the superhero of government regulation, springing to the 
rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try 
to breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should 
disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the 
forces of concentration. It should use the government's money and muscle 
to get new technology—especially fast Internet connections—into the 
homes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (An 
analogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and 
the Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush 
people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush 
people blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many 
expectations and stirred too many passions.)
But Michael Powell's F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been 
conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the 
F.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him 
signals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of 
the F.C.C.'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn't mean he has 
been inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further 
infuriates his critics—in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and 
the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of 
F.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he's 
having the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, 
when he was asked what he was going to do about the "digital 
divide"—that is, economic inequality in access to the Internet—he said, 
"You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I'd like to have one and 
I can't afford one." At the National Cable & Telecommunications 
Association convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of 
tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a 
Not long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until 
1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest 
Washington, near the city's open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at 
the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody 
else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building 
looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. 
Even the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and 
fluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and 
walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a 
jeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because 
of the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he 
became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly 
the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of 
the market before the fact—"prophylactically," as he likes to say—should 
wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust 
litigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and 
then became a protégé of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division 
of the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government's 
legal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of 
the New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell's political 
skill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush 
Administration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but 
also maintains close ties to Bush's nemesis Senator John McCain, of 
Arizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his 
enduring love of law school—"It's sort of like a law-school study 
session over there," one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to 
confirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law 
students, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.
I began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions 
of the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the 
airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?
"I think we'll never know," Powell said. "I don't think it's an 
automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably 
the best analogue. We don't seize all the land in the United States and 
say, 'The government will issue licenses to use land.' If my neighbor 
puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law 
about what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If 
a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a 
similar proposition. There are scholars who argue—indeed, the famous 
Ronald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about this—that 
spectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds 
of ways that we're accustomed to."
Talking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he 
doesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He 
slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in 
ironic air quotes. He's like your libertarian friend in college who 
enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions 
about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he 
sees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he 
thought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications 
Act had been excessive.
"I would start with a caveat," Powell said. "Look, I can't fault those 
judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. 
They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. 
But, frankly, I've always been a little bit critical. First of all, 
anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close 
to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President 
on down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. I mean, I 
don't know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, 
or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that 
were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts 
reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. 
But, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet 
excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it 
certainly was.
"But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of 
expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the 
economy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically 
exaggerated expectation—by the leadership of the commission, by 
politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a 
gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones 
that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to 
see numbers go up on the board."
Powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. " 
'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see 
thirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the 
Bells to bleed! Then we'll know we've succeeded.' " Now Powell returned 
to being Powell. "I think that expectation was astonishingly 
unrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they're 
there. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And 
the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There's no 
question, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much 
debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business 
How could the Telecom Act have been handled better? "We could have 
chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were 
slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system," 
Powell said. "Money chased what seemed like government-promised 
opportunity. The problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're 
in it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This 
debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some 
ways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability."
Powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there 
had been a more "reasonable" level of investment. "No, we wouldn't have 
every home in America with competitive choice yet—but we don't anyway. I 
don't think it's the remonopolization of telephone service. I don't buy 
that. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn't? The 
part of the story that didn't materialize was that people thought so 
would MCI WorldCom and Sprint."
Other local phone companies, he added, hadn't materialized as viable 
businesses, either, and they never might. "Everybody's always saying, 
'The regulators did this and this and this.' But, candidly, the story's 
quite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six 
years to give them a chance. Conditions don't get that good except once 
every thirty years, and it didn't happen. So, whatever the reason, we're 
looking at a WorldCom that's teetering. We're looking at a long-distance 
business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. & T. is 
breaking itself up. Sprint has struggled."
Could the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies 
stronger? "At the F.C.C.? I think I'll just be blunt. My political 
answer? Yes, there's all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try 
to help. But I can't find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. 
I can't mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. 
investigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don't have 
those kinds of levers. I don't know whether anybody does. At some point, 
companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from 
dying." Powell couldn't have made it much clearer that he doesn't think 
it's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has 
demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist 
gestures—in August, for example, five months after disbanding the 
F.C.C.'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was 
appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the 
communications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding 
out the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore 
up the telecom industry.
I asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one 
company provided cable television and only one provided local phone 
service. "Yes," he said. "It concerns us that there's one of each of 
those things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one 
of each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications 
capabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other." 
Anyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to 
provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will 
provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. 
"So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question 
is, Does it stay that way?"
The concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of 
information did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that 
people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, 
which distorts markets. "If this were just economics, it's easy. If you 
were to say to me, 'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we 
know how to do that—the econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a 
market's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is 
other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take 
the question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption 
there is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic 
viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. I 
think that's a possibility. I don't think it's nearly the possibility 
that's ascribed to it sometimes."
Powell explained, "Sometimes when we see very pointed political or 
parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the 
same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh 
exists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off 
the planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, 
and then we have policies like"—here his tone went from ironic to 
sarcastic—"the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis 
of what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed 
and opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic 
fairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out."
F.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he 
can't make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries 
he regulates—so he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the 
market, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he's carrying 
water for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is 
planning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed 
Attorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn't want to do anything 
at the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he's 
waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, 
so that he doesn't wind up going first and getting caught in the 
crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television 
networks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of 
Telecom, after Colin Powell's idea that the United States should never 
commit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, 
and an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he 
says, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and 
irreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.
"This is why elections matter," Reed Hundt, who isn't happy about what 
has become of his Telecom Act, told me. It's true that the F.C.C.—much 
more than, say, the war in Afghanistan—is a case in which a Gore 
Administration would be acting quite differently from the Bush 
Administration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but 
there's no question whether communications companies have noticed. The 
arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would 
have done if Gore had won. Next election, they'll help the party that 
helped them. If the Republicans win, policy will tilt further in the 
arbocks' favor. If they lose, perhaps the arbocks' rivals—the 
long-distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts—with their 
friends now in power, will stage a comeback. America's present is not 
unrecognizably different from America's past.

Broadband's killer application — the one activity that dwarfs all others —
is online gaming, which 80 percent of South Koreans under 25 play, according
to one recent study. Critics say the burgeoning industry is creating
millions of zombified addicts who are turning on and tuning into computer
games, and dropping out of school and traditional group activities, becoming
uncommunicative and even violent because of the electronic games they play.
"Game players don't have normal social relationships anymore," said Kim Hyun
Soo, a 36-year-old psychiatrist who is chairman of the Net Addiction
Treatment Center, one of many groups that have sprung up to cope with
Internet game addiction. "Young people are losing the ability to relate to
others, except through games. People who become addicted are prone to
violence, even when they are not playing.

Hi All,
Anyone ever try connecting at 1200bps in Linux? I've got a USR 56K
Faxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have to
connect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side,
but the modem handshake always fails at this speed.
The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to
~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server
as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps.
Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windows
worked first time(!?), any ideas?
Baud 1200 7 data bits Even Parity
I am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:
... which is most of the defaults.
USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42)) 
& set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2)
But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving
btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring their
modems may be difficult.

I don't think so: it should be getting a stream of PS from stdin,
but it's not. The printing/spooling system is executing gs but
somehow failing to provide it with input.
That might clarify that the later part of the system works, but I
suspect the problem is earlier.

I have translated the article in full - see 
end of post (I think that I've done a far 
better job than the Google translation - at 
least it's readable now - any corrections
Stuff in {}'s is my (and others) additions 
to the debate.
My apologies if I've paraphrased anybody 
incorrectly, I will be glad to retract if 
anyone is miffed.
The article makes four main points.
1) Absence of critical clauses. 
In this case, the idea is that the licence 
is invalid because it doesn't specify
under what country's law the GPL is governed.
2) Specification in English only.
That for the end user (as opposed to businesses), 
the GPL doesn't apply because it's not written 
in French.
3) Arbitary licence change.
The point here is that (under French law) the 
author can change the terms of the licence 
arbitarily. This is because any granting of 
rights by an author must be clearly delimited
in terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and 
times. In the absence of such limitations, the 
original author has the right to change his 
software back to closed on a whim.
David Neary makes the point that the copyright 
holder automatically retains the right to change 
the licence.
Scott replies it simply requires authorisation from 
all *copyright holders*
That's not my understanding. French law allows a 
GPL type licence *_on condition_* that the 
specific conditions of the granting of such
rights are clear - if they are not, there is
nothing to stop the original author taking
back "his work". The lawyers see this
(correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL).
4) Hidden defects.
Roughly, this clause means that the author(s) 
is/are liable for any defects if the consumer 
is not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up 
and data is lost, then the authors are liable.
Ciaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have 
similar clauses - the point here is that they 
are *_all_* invalid - just that this one 
affects the GPL also.
Niall O'Broinn makes the point that it is not
a sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement
and that's why it doesn't come under this point.
I would suggest that the whole thrust of this
article has been to see software "sales" (even
if no money changes hands) as governed very
much by consumer law (in France anyway).
Rick Moen makes the point that it is not
a sale but rather a granting of rights which
are not default. 
See the bit about even the granting of 
rights by an author having to be 
explicitly specified - under French law.
The fact that two IP lawyers in France think that
the GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that 
there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.
5) Roughly.
There may be other reasons under French 
law why the  GPL may be invalid.
Freedom(a) is worth more than these 
imperfect licences.
Specialised lawyers look at the GPL.
Lawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to 
the court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both 
specialised in the area of intellectual property 
examine the "free" licences and in particular the 
GPL. They have published their study
in the review "Proprietes intellectuelles 
(Intellectual property)[1]" and their
conclusion is grim.
Their approach is interesting. The problem for 
them is not to know whether freedom is valid under 
French law (for them the question is a moot point)
but rather they asked themselves about the form 
and the content of the text of free licences, and 
in particular the GPL. The problem is not free 
programmes, but rather the licence contracts of 
free programmes.
Absence of critical clauses.
The authors tell us that first of all, the 
reference to "copyright" is not legally 
sufficient in the framework of international 
contracts  (which is the case of licence 
contracts for programmes developed and spread 
via the Internet). The idea of copyright can 
basically include differences from one country 
to another. This is why, under international 
contracts, it is necessary to specify to which 
laws one is referring (French law, American &c.).
The authors only found three public licences 
which were correctly formulated on this point: 
QPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public
Specification in the English language.
Next, the authors remind us that (at least in 
France), no clause in a contract may be contrary 
to French law [2]. However, it turns out that a 
licence such as the GPL is contrary to French law 
in several respects. Firstly, it is written in 
English and the FSF doesn't officially approve 
translations. 
The "Toubon law" obliges this sort 
of contract to be written in French, including for 
businesses since the notion of "user" applies not 
only to consumers, but also to businesses, 
professionals &c. 
Contacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, 
lawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as 
far as business is concerned, the "Toubon 
law" is probably doomed to change since 
it is in contradiction of European directives 
on the subject, but whatever about that, the 
problem is still valid for individuals, and 
while waiting for it (French law) to change, 
French companies have to deal with it, since 
it is the law of the land.
A programme under the GPL can suddenly 
change licence.
Another problem, much more serious, is 
that according to French law, the author of 
a free programme can, at any time, invoke 
the invalidity of the licence for this 
software by simply changing the licence.
In effect, the law of intellectual 
property stipulates that the granting of  
rights by the author is subordinate to 
the condition that each of these granted 
rights be the object of a distinct clause 
in the granting act (i.e. the licence) and 
that the granting of any such rights be 
delimited with respect to its scope and its 
grantees, and also with respect to its 
location (i.e. where such rights may be 
excersised)  and duration of any such grants. 
[3] This is not the case of the GPL nor of
other free licences. Briefly, this means 
that in France, or elsewhere if the author 
is French, that which is under the GPL could 
revert to proprietary from one day to the next. 
The problem of the guarantee "hidden defects".
An other very serious flaw is that of the 
guarantee. The GPL licences and others show 
that the software is delivered "without 
guarantee". You are going to immediately
reply that commercical programmes carry the 
same clause in their licence contracts,
and this is correct. However, whatever is 
written in a licence contract, one cannot
free oneself from the "guarantee from 
hidden defects", since it is imposed in the 
Civil Code. This concept is poorly understood 
by the layman, it protects the buyer
(whoever it may be, individual or business, 
since it specifies the Civil Code and not 
consumer protection law) against hidden 
defects, deliberate or made in good faith by 
the seller. 
For example, if one buys a pair of socks 
in a sale, and the shop has a notice 
specifying that "Sale items are neither 
refunded nor exchanged", and on arriving 
home you notice that one of the socks has 
a hole in it, several scenarios are possible.
You could have checked the socks before 
purchase: the flaw is deemed "obvious" and
you can sing for your money.
You couldn't check the socks (they were 
packaged for example), and in this case, 
despite the notice "neither refund nor 
exchange", you may invoke "hidden defect" 
and have them changed or obtain a refund, 
it's up to you. 
Personally, I have already invoked in shops 
the "hidden defect" clause and it always 
worked well (shopkeepers are always very 
cooperative if you quote a couple of words 
of the Civil Code). 
The concept of hidden defect is rather 
wide, it is necessary that you hadn't 
the possibility of discovering the defect 
before buying the product and then 
(according to the Civil Code) that you 
wouldn't have bought it at that price if 
you had known about the
The third case which is much rarer , is 
if you are able to show that the vendor had
knowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn't 
inform you. In this case, not only does he 
have to reimburse the product, but all 
expenses incurred by the sale (metro 
tickets to go to the shop, the fuse 
which blew when you plugged it in &c.)
This idea of "hidden defect" applies to
 all products, including programmes. This 
was made abundantly clear by the 
authorities (and the courts) surrounding 
Y2K. 
This is particularly inconvenient for 
free programmes, since a site which 
offers a Linux distro for download is 
supposed to provide a guarantee against 
hidden flaws.
LinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if 
in the case of a free programme, 
one could speak about a "hidden" defect 
since the source code was available, 
he replied "Actually, concerning the 
guarantee, the question of obvious 
defect will arise. This analyis will 
be different depending on whether the 
person who downloads the distribution 
is an IT professional or not". 
OpenSource has this advantage over 
the proprietary programme: it protects 
the distributor against a guarantee of
hidden defect insofar as the buy is an 
IT person. But, for distribution to the 
public at large, the problem remains 
the same.
Roughly Speaking.
Lawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, 
this study is far from being exhaustive 
and many other areas could be explored. 
During this interview, we asked ourselves, 
for example, about the fragility of the 
GPL clause which forbids linking source 
code under the GPL with proprietary code. 
In effect, the laws of intellectual 
property give the right to the user 
to modify a programme with the
intention of permitting interoperability 
with another programme. If for that,
I need to link with a proprietary library 
(communication protocol, device driver)
I may consider as "null and void" this 
clause of the GPL.
The conclusion of this study is a wake 
up call for the community. "Freedom" 
merits more than these shoddy licences, 
which should be modified before court 
cases over them proliferate and put at 
risk the undeniable originality of 
this effort.

Do a wget of a file of known length, in a script that runs "date" before
and after (or equivalent).
Be aware that speed between you and your upstream link is one thing;
speed through countless congested routers to a faraway location may be
quite another.  Remember that hardware-level compression is a factor.
(The file you wget will probably be precompressed.)
In the area of the slightly more exotic, be aware that different traffic
may have higher priority and thus more available bandwidth at various
points in the transit to/from you -- and that some traffic may go via 
different paths coming vs. going.
Be aware that raw bulk transfer speed may not be the only thing that
matters:  Depending on what you're doing, the modem's connection latency
might matter, and this differs widely between modems.  (It matters more
for interactive sessions, e.g., ssh remote logins, where each keystroke
is echoed from remote.)

The GPL and similar licences are explicitly permanent grants of rights
attached to an instance of his work.  (The other stuff mentioned
concerns contract law, e.g., the required element of privity, etc.)
No, the author has the right to issue _additional_ instances under a
different licence, such as a proprietary ("closed" [sic]) licence.  
The analysis, here and elsewhere, concerns contract law.  This isn't
contract law.
This isn't the first time copyright attorneys have stumbled on this
subject.  I'm sure it won't be the last.

Hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install *only* packages who

Looks and sounds a hell of a lot like Clare's cat, Violence...
A tall tail or is it a prowling panther?
Security cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the cat
The Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a 
sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera.
Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in 
Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley 
in just four weeks.
Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside 
the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security 
cameras captured it on film.
The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and 
two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body.
He said: "It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of 
a hunter.
"It looked at me calmly before moving on."
The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had 
been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news 
of the sighting.
His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images 
of the large cat prowling through their garden.
She said: "I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate 
for it to get hurt."
Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their 
usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at "nothing" in the garden but barked 
that morning.
He warned: "I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they 
might jump you."
Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead 
Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.
If you have seen the big cat, call News Shopper on 01689 885712.

An investigation has been launched after punch bags on sale in Greenwich 
were found to be stuffed with incontinence pads and bandages.
Trading standards officers, working for Greenwich Council, were alerted to 
the situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, 
Charlton, was found to be full of bandages.
Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a 
woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking 
for the filling to be tested.
The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High 
Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was 
horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.
So far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they 
contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet.
Cabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: "This 
is one of the strangest stories I have every heard.
"Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover 
why the bags contain such unusual contents."

Texas Pacific, in addition to its multibillion dollar portfolio detailed below, actually does invest in promising new companies, not just turnarounds. It's just that KnowNow is waaay to small of a part of their $7.2B portfolio... so far!
Texas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to Spend
August 25, 2002
By RIVA D. ATLAS and EDWARD WONG 
It was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed when
he became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways
last March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner
and meaner business plan, keep his planes flying and
renegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flipped
through his files and found the number for the Texas
Pacific Group, an investment firm headed by David
Bonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation
for fixing problem companies. 
Mr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines,
had watched Texas Pacific's partners turn an investment of
$66 million in the airline, made three years after it filed
for bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600
million. And they had made nearly as much on their stake in
America West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. 
That search for advice turned into an offer. Why not let
Texas Pacific have a role in US Airways' revival? asked
Richard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr.
Siegel reached. 
In June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again. And days
before US Airways announced its plans to file for
bankruptcy two weeks ago - but after it had negotiated
about $550 million in concessions with its unions - Texas
Pacific, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco, agreed to
kick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keep
the company operating during bankruptcy. It also agreed to
buy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company,
and take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges
from bankruptcy - unless another investor surfaces with a
better offer. 
"One of the reasons we were interested is few other folks
were," said James Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific, in
an interview after the bankruptcy filing. "There aren't
many people around with the stomach or the knowledge to
delve into the airline industry." 
Texas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buying
businesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bonderman
made their names during the recession of the early 1990's
with investments in Continental and America West. The
firm's hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping
companies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its
extensive network of contacts for talented replacements. 
Now the partners are again looking for trouble. In the last
year alone, Texas Pacific has announced or completed six
acquisitions, most in unloved industries like
semiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. Just last month,
it announced plans to buy Burger King, which has been
losing market share, for $2.26 billion. It is also bidding
for Bankgesellschaft Berlin, a large and troubled bank. 
The most creative, and potentially lucrative, of these
deals could be Texas Pacific's acquisition last November of
MEMC Electronic Materials, a semiconductor company, for $6
- yes, just $6 - in cash. It will also guarantee a $150
million bank loan. 
In the last few years, most firms that specialize in
leveraged buyouts - the use of junk bonds, bank loans and
other borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies -
have been largely inactive. Falling stock prices have made
managements reluctant to sell cheaply. Companies that are
for sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze. 
Texas Pacific is different. "This is a terrific environment
for them," said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of the
Blackstone Group, which also specializes in buyouts. 
Mark Attanasio, a managing director at Trust Company of the
West, which has invested with Texas Pacific, said: "Most
other buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing.
You don't see many guys wanting to take on operational
fixes." 
Like most other buyout firms, Texas Pacific tries to keep
its inner workings private: its partners rarely grant
interviews and its Web site is perpetually under
construction. Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Coulter and William Price,
the third founding partner, declined to be interviewed for
this article. 
Mr. Bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts and
bright, patterned socks. "He likes argyle socks, and they
tend to fall down around his ankles," said Henry Miller, an
investment banker who advises troubled companies. Early in
his career, when he was a Washington lawyer, Mr. Bonderman
argued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit. 
When a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated, he is known
for obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekking
in places like Pakistan, Nepal and, most recently, Bhutan.
"Whenever I see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up on
my caller I.D., I know it's David calling," said one
investment banker who often works with Mr. Bonderman. 
Mr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as the
chief investment officer for Robert Bass, the Texas oilman.
Mr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by making
early bets in industries like cable television and taking
stakes in troubled companies like American Savings & Loan,
which had been seized by the government. Over nearly a
decade, Mr. Bonderman's picks earned an average annual
return of 63 percent for Mr. Bass. 
In 1993, Mr. Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr.
Coulter, a former Lehman Brothers banker who had also
worked for Mr. Bass. They teamed up later that year with
Mr. Price, a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain &
Company, a consulting firm, to form Texas Pacific. 
The three men have complementary skills, investment bankers
and other deal makers said. Mr. Bonderman is the master
strategist and Mr. Coulter is good at structuring deals and
the detailed management of the firm's purchases. Mr. Price
often recruits managers and advises on operational issues. 
"David is very much the optimist, very much the deal
maker," said Greg Brenneman, a former president of
Continental. "Jim is very much a counterbalance to David.
He will sit back and ask the tough questions. He will
approach investments a little bit more skeptically than
David does." 
By the end of the 1990's, Texas Pacific was well
established in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billion
from pension funds and other investors in early 2000. To
celebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented San
Francisco's City Hall and hired the B-52's to play at a
party. 
But as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacific
hesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made no
deals. They checked out some of the biggest corporate
blowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, but
stayed away, finding the prices and the quality of the
businesses untenable. 
Instead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing
investments, taking more than $2 billion in profits during
that stretch. 
"They started to cash out early in the cycle," said Mario
Giannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a money
management firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacific
investors. 
The good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for Texas
Pacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies that
needed its help. 
But Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the
rough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the health
maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the
mid-1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in new
managers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a
$280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italian
motorcycle maker, whose profits have since more than
quadrupled. 
But Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought at
the top of the market. Texas Pacific's $560 million
investment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, for
which it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997,
has been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase of
Bally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demand
for luxury goods. 
Texas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, a
semiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker,
both of which filed for bankruptcy. 
Some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm's
performance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in
two investment funds it raised over the last decade. The
first fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and
including investments made through March 1997, should
return more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacific
investor. But its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997
- could return less than half that, this investor
estimated, since the firm had less time to take profits on
these investments before the stock market sank. 
But because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings
in the second fund, profits on these investments could
rebound. It is hoping, for example, that with new
management in place, J. Crew will turn around as the
economy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, "their
returns look pretty good when you consider that some other
funds won't return any capital" to investors. 
But with the weak economy throwing many companies into
trouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier
success, the investor said. "They should do exceptionally
well," he said. 
Texas Pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. It
relies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructure
troubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, except
for surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, it
replaces managers. 
Less than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy,
for example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as his
old friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led it
to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. 
Continental's board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, then
brought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, and
in October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chief
executive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaul
of the company and is now considered a great turnaround
artist of the industry. 
"The biggest conflict I've ever seen was with Bob
Ferguson," said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel for
the Federal Aviation Administration, in describing the
thinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982
Braniff bankruptcy. "He chose Bethune over his longtime
friend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a
better job." 
At America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even more
extensive management overhaul. This time, the charge was
led by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors. 
W. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr.
Coulter's home in San Francisco to interview for the job of
chief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr.
Parker said the two men quickly realized they had "somewhat
kindred spirits." 
The board replaced most senior managers at America West,
except William Franke, the chief executive, who stepped
down last September. His restructuring plan had made the
airline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from
bankruptcy in August 1994. 
Texas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worth
about $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, and
the group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. 
"These are not passive investors, nor am I," said Donald L.
Sturm, a Denver businessman who serves on Continental's
board with Mr. Bonderman and Mr. Price. "You're active.
Your money is at stake. Your reputation is at stake." 
After overseeing managers who worked successfully with
unions at Continental and America West, Texas Pacific has a
good reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airways
was interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said Chris
Chiames, a spokesman for the airline. 
Mr. Siegel wanted an investor who would "be as labor
friendly as possible," Mr. Chiames said. But US Airways can
still entertain other bids this fall, and Marvin Davis, the
billionaire investor from Los Angeles, has expressed
interest. 
Texas Pacific's investment in Burger King, made with
Goldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after two
years of discussions among Texas Pacific's partners and the
chain's franchisees - even before the company, which had
been owned by Diageo, the liquor company, was put up for
sale, said Julian Josephson, chairman of the National
Franchisee Association, which represents most Burger King
franchisees. 
"We liked what they had to say about the human component of
the businesses they buy," Mr. Josephson said. Many other
owners, he added, "are dismissive of labor." 
At Burger King, Texas Pacific will also be working with an
executive it knows. Burger King's chief executive is John
Dasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines,
who met Mr. Bonderman and his partners when Northwest
bought out their stake in Continental in 1998. 
Unlike most buyout firms, Texas Pacific remains enamored
with the technology industry, despite the failure of so
many start-ups the last two years. It has focused on the
semiconductor industry, which like the airline industry is
highly cyclical. So far, though, results have been mixed. 
The firm's 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation,
which makes equipment for high-speed Internet connections,
has been a huge success. Texas Pacific split it in two and
took both parts public in the late 1990's, selling most of
its stakes for 23 times its investment. But a much larger
investment, its $400 million acquisition of Zilog, the chip
maker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis in
Asia caused chip prices to plummet. Zilog filed for
bankruptcy last year. 
Texas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third
company, ON Semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6
billion three years ago. It invested $100 million more last
year. 
Its latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for MEMC,
may prove the most lucrative. The cost of mailing the
payment to E.On, based in Düsseldorf, Germany, was actually
more than the acquisition, one executive close to the deal
said. 
Texas Pacific, and its partners in the deal, Trust Company
of the West and Leonard Green & Partners, agreed to
guarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. Texas
Pacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most of
which it swapped for more stock in the company. 
"They did a good job of timing the acquisition," said
Nabeel Gareeb, the company's chief executive, who noted
that in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profit
since the fourth quarter of 2000. 
But Texas Pacific's interest in airlines is clearly
sizable. Besides its involvement in Continental, America
West and US Airways, the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet,
the catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group. 
Two years ago, Texas Pacific started a Web-based discount
ticket service called Hotwire. It put up most of the $75
million in seed money, then persuaded six airlines to
invest with it, said Karl Peterson, the chief executive.
Hotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, as
Priceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its Web site
but does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until
after the sale. 
The contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt
Hotwire, which is privately owned. Mr. Peterson said that
the company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacific
remains committed to it. 
Last spring, Mr. Peterson met Mr. Bonderman in Aspen to
talk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding. Mr. Bonderman
seemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down the
steep Internet chute. But he does have his limits on risk,
Mr. Peterson discovered. Before going down the mountain,
Mr. Bonderman strapped on a helmet.

Thugs of South Boston and The Revenge of the Bandit Princess
The Geodesic Economy
Robert A. Hettinga
Sunday, August 25, 2002
(BOSTON) When you think about it one way, the FBI/Winter Hill vs.
Patriarcha/Angiulo Cosa Nostra fight was just another race war
between thugs.
Put crudely, and at its most racist, the FBI and the Winter Hill Gang
were the (mostly) Irish thugs, and Patriarcha's "family" were, of
course, the (mostly) Italian thugs.
Think Scorsese's upcoming "Gangs of New York", only with
counter-reformatory overtones. Hoover's South Boston "social-club"
putsch, starting in the mid 1960's, was particularly audacious in
hindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwrite
a reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation's rackets by
the Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched not
for New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US,
only makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI to
its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime
there once and for all.
The result, as we all found out, wasn't swapping the heroin of
Italian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone. Hoover was,
posthumously, swapping it for Oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine
- -- or, more properly, PCP. The absolute psychopathology of violence
in Whitey Bulger's crack-cocaine-era reign of Boston's drug markets,
like the identical FBI-sponsored reigns or violent horror by other
also-rans in cities across the US as a whole, went up whole orders of
magnitude, not mere percentage points.
As Stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it's own. And, make
no mistake, J. Edgar Hoover was directly responsible that "quality"
of carnage, nation-wide.
So, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of one
gang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at
least, business as usual. Same stuff, different century, with
apparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground on
the gears of "justice" like so much hamburger.
However, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was
"greasing", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could
love: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence --
on paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door,
but still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken's famous "bluenoses
and busybodies".
It all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of
beginnings. What she couldn't do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundy
then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a
smaller, "manageable" demand. The bloody result was, like nine more
heads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition,
in more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on.
Every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or
harmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now,
apparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing
happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volstead
years. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugely
lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently
scale newly-legislated "barriers to competition" imposed on them by
the state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of
those substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of
evil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly
coercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred
liberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry.
As Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don't need
government if nobody's breaking the law. In some twisted corollary to
Parkinson's Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people,
breaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they
confiscate at tax time.
And, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probably
echo here his father Milton's famous observation that government
regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and
never the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even,
*especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in
the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our
government now imposes on us.
And there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati.
In fact, Hayek himself, in "The Road to Serfdom", couldn't have
predicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover's blatant
imposition, "for our own good", of Vietnam-era statist power at the
neighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn't have had
better "useful idiots" than Hoover did -- and neither, by an
absolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover.
Useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots who
were eating out of Hoover's power-craven hand for the entire middle
of the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger's hand, whether they knew it
or not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you'll notice, which
saw the increasingly steady imposition of "mob" violence, and market
control, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the
imaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting,
movie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian Little
Caesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now
strictly political, descendents.
In terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr.
Salvati and the others, dead or alive, as a "transfer-price", in
human lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-style
Vietnam-era Keynesian "social-cost" input-output accounting at its
most despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that
was committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic
control, in the name of what really was, as you'll now agree, just a
race war between thugs up in Boston.
This shouldn't be a surprise, really. All race wars are at least
fought by thugs, though they're usually conceived elsewhere, and
endorsed, at the time, by all the "right" people, for all the "right"
As far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson's observation
that a "prince" is just a stationary bandit.
Though, given his penchant for women's clothing, for other men, and,
what's actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of
people of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J.
Edgar Hoover a bandit "princess", instead.
"Bandit Queen", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens --
and real bandits -- everywhere.

Hoover's F.B.I. and the Mafia: Case of Bad Bedfellows Grows By FOX
BOSTON, Aug. 24 - It was March 1965, in the early days of J. Edgar
Hoover's war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressional
investigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of
New England's organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca.
Two gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr.
Patriarca's permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan,
"as they were having a problem with him," according to an F.B.I. log
of the conversation. "Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.," the
F.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in an
alley, shot six times.
It was an extraordinary situation: The Federal Bureau of
Investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known
gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England
Mafia was involved.
But when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real
killers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - were
left alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to
death or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing
to do with it.
One, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with
the Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I.
for $300 million for false imprisonment.
His is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., the
Justice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled,
corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.'s Boston
office in its effort to bring down the mob.
The lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years
in a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some of
the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light,
including documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarca
approved the murder. They were released as part of an investigation
by the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured the
department into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston.
The documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparently
including Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents
were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were
protecting them from prosecution.
"J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal
himself," said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati's lawyer. "He allowed a
witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect
one of his informants."
Mr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati and
may have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan shark
who worked for Mr. Barboza.
Asked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr.
Salvati's innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, a
spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing the
pending litigation.
A Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate
misconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of the
investigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaiting
sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and
obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were
F.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent and
Stephen Flemmi are brothers.
The Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton,
Republican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Boston
office to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau's knowledge
that Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr.
Deegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime,
including who fired the first shot.
Then, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover's office demanded to know what
progress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer.
In a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Boston
office said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot
wounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca "potentially
could be an excellent informant."
The agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to have
killed seven men, "and, from all indications, he is going to continue
to commit murder." Nevertheless, the agent said, "the informant's
potential outweighs the risk involved."
A Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. "The most
frightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi's murders,
the director does not even respond," the investigator said. "There is
no message not to use a murderer as a government informant."
The origin of the corruption scandal was public and political
pressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing
power of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I.
agents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close ties
to a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr.
Both sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and
the trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventually
helped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlled
organized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger's gang was able to take
over the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while
the F.B.I. looked the other way.
One reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr.
Patriarca's involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressional
investigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device
in his Providence, R.I., headquarters. The F.B.I. agent who
transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was
coming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device,
the investigators say.
Mr. Salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted
in 1997 by Gov. William F. Weld. Last year, while he was still on
parole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts state
judge after the Justice Department task force made public documents
suggesting his innocence.
Two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. Their
survivors have joined the fourth man, Peter Limone, in a $375 million
lawsuit against the Justice Department. Mr. Limone was sentenced to
die in the electric chair. His life was spared only when
Massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974.
Mr. Salvati lives in a modest apartment in Boston's North End with
his wife, Marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30
years. Each week Mr. Salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put
on the television set. It was, Mr. Garo said, all they had of each

Not sure about MG, though I know pretty much everything he penned got into

So, last night around 5:30AM I'm woken up by a loud *craaack*, followed by
one of the most dreaded sounds a homeowner ever hears: vast quantities of
water spilling onto the floor. The water is coming from the bathroom, the
toilet specifically. Turns out the water cistern on the top of the toilet
had cracked down the side, and was spilling out all the water.
So, after shutting off the water and mopping up, I was left to ponder what
are the odds of having mechanical failure of a large rectangular porcelain
bowl, in the absence of any visible stressors (like someone striking it with
a sledgehammer)? We hadn't done anything unusual to the toilet in the recent
past -- just normal use. I've *never* heard of this happening to anyone I
know. The guts, yeah, they fail all the time. But the storage bowl -- never.

Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away is a

The problem with the entertainment industry is that they engage in
business and pricing tactics that make anything Microsoft was ever

more important than maximizing profit as long as they can make a
profit.  They don't need your carrot, so they only engage in reasonable
business behavior when you are carrying a very large stick, and few
people swing a stick large enough.  They are being chronically

thx for the thoughts gentlemen (yes as someone said i use terms loosely) -
quality: snobs only care about mpixels. this is about communications.  the
general public cares about speed not quality.  how is akamai doing these
days? not to mention any other QOS businesses that come to mind.
implementation: point about hooking to usb, wires, etc. AGREE 100%. these
implementations are super clunky, attachable camera needs to be integrated a
la nokia model.  basically useless until better handsets are released i
adoption: ian brought up the 'fax' problem.  brilliant thing is, this is far
more personal than faxes so can be justified more easily and marketed in
family packs etc. but yes, the usual rules apply as MMS phones have network
content: who cares about content?  that no one can think of 'useful' content
is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users
communications.  its anything and everything.  avg person could easily send
half dozen pics to a dozen people a day.  mainly humorous i'd guess. who
cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.
display: why are dig camera displays better than cell phones?  does anyone
know who makes these small displays and what the trends are around them?
misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same
thing about '1 hour photo' processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better
resultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the plant
had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital camera,
and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of
decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the
photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS
didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its
greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS
traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,
SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.
ps:  it is relatively amusing that one 'low resolution' complaint dropped
just after Joe watched a CARTOON on his television..

right Mike,
i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart.  my opinion is
only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant
show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing).  i am
mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting.
my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways
once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see
amongst each other.  that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on
their phones, or that people will spend more time w/images than voice.  just
that it is fundamental.  from news to crime to privacy to dating to family
life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion
of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of
their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of
photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes
things 'big time'.

argument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who
communicate by pictures?  Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is
such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find
yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?
I don't buy it.
For most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient
mechanism.  For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say not
nearly as often as words.  Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and
such are games?  Because images are usually not the most efficient way to
get a message across.
Again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with "you just
don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this").  I wasn't saying
that MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't
easy.  I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a way
that "changed the face of communications".
I'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why
people would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into the
phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see
people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to
other people.  But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this over
sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or
offline) photoalbum.
I don't think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own pics
right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That's
one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instant
view part.  I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want
"instant view", but also "instant show".  Which is what this service
offers.  I'm not convinced that most people want "instant show".  I think
people like to package their pictures and show them.  That's why people put
together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while
they explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally "instant show" is nice, but
it's just "nice" on occasion.  I still can't see how it becomes a integral
messaging method.
What's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it
from one phone to another?  There has to be *some* benefit, even if it's
silly if people are going to flock to it.
I'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.
The *only* really intriguing idea I've heard about things like MMS lately
are Dan Gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event
will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile
phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of
what happened - before the press even gets there.
Willing to be proven wrong,
PS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as
they currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.

What is MIME?
standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the
world-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending
images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text
files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part
of the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a
recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. 
How can I read a MIME message?
Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use
which do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing
number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular
University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host
In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation
capability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do
not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is
still hope! 
There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME
message.  One of the more versatile is called "munpack".  It was developed
at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the
available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with
older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also
decode messages in split-uuencoded format. 
Does MIME replace UUENCODE?
Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so
that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical
limitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust
encoding called "Base64" which has been carefully designed to survive the
message transformations made by certain email gateways. 
How can I learn more about MIME?
The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via
anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: 
     o  US East Coast                            
     o  US West Coast                            
     o  Pacific Rim                              
     o  Europe                                   
Look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt
which includes a periodic posting of a "Frequently Asked Questions" list.

A terrible argument. There are better technical solutions to privacy

    hazards (fwd)
Hi Kragen,
   This is an interesting analysis.  I think that there are a couple
of nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market will
be well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the
most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix
their systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, and
you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you
might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.
   There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is very
important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes
of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available
vulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automated
methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about
the quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research into
a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you
can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so
you can make and test predictions.
   I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we
wouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.  And the security
admin's job would be a lot harder.

| Subject: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards
| 
| On August 7th, an entity known as "iDEFENSE" sent out an announcement,
| which is appended to this email.  Briefly, "iDEFENSE", which bills
| itself as "a global security intelligence company", is offering cash
| for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software
| that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell
| anyone else.
| 
| If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a
| very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.
| 
| At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research
| known as "full disclosure"; people who discover security
| vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short
| while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem
| --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the
| vulnerability, if possible.  
| 
| This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by
| CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call "responsible
| disclosure" --- never release working exploit code, and never release
| any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released
| a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers
| vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked
| on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people
| wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem
| was.
| 
| The underground computer criminal community would often discover and
| exploit these same holes for months or years while the "responsible
| disclosure" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the
| underground, vulnerable.
| 
| The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known
| are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to
| reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,
| turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and
| detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less
| useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see
| security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so
| prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as
| long as possible.
| 
| iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous
| than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in
| a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding
| discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  
| 
| Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently
| including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the
| secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software
| vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to
| Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if
| HP retained Snosoft's "consulting services".  HP considered this
| extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the
| information.
| 
| If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,
| together, add up to a catastrophe.
| 
| First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to
| the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,
| I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime
| syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.
| 
| Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will
| become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be
| --- just as in the "responsible disclosure" days --- that the good
| guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority
| of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.
| 
| I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the
| vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's
| plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets
| them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the
| people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when
| credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.
| Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site
| administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some
| negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.
| 
| I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability
| information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to
| execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that
| means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who
| are good at networked theft may not yet exist.
| 
| There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as
| Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR
| than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in
| Samba, for example.
| 
| Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either
| motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public
| interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or
| personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating
| a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly
| increase the availability of that information to the people who can
| afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.
| 
| Let's not let that happen.

| Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program
| 
| 
| Greetings,
| 
| iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability
| Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance
| notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.
| 
| iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following
| provides answers to some basic questions about the program:
| 
| Q. How will it work?
| A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish
| security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number
| of motivations, including the following:
| 
|          * Pure love of security research
|          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks
|          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products
|          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure
| 
| The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the
| Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the
| work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following
| items:
| 
|          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)
|          * The amount of detail and analysis provided
|          * The potential severity level for the information shared
|          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other
|            software and hardware potentially affected
|          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs
|          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE
| 
| Q. Who should contribute to the VCP?
| A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other
| entity.
| 
| Q. Why are you launching this program?
| A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions
| to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More
| often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the
| original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is
| compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the
| public at large are warned in a timely manner.
| 
| Q. Who gets the credit?
| A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or
| exploit information.
| 
| Q. When can I contribute?
| The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.
| 
| questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please
| 
| Regards,
|

I finally let go of my Irix Magic desktop and window manager
and evaluated several other window managers. Having lost my 10 years
of customization with my X10 and then X11 desktop at one point
at UCI, I promised myself that I'd never get attached to
another WM.  I limped along in the default Gnome desktop, I
had a few unsuccessful stabs at the Solaris open view 
desktop, but nothing really stuck.   Because of this along
with SGI's love of pre-configured, pre-compiled freeware[1],
I never really made the jump from Irix to Linux either.  
After installing the enlightenment WM, I have to say, I am
really enlightened.  It's definitely a far cry from the no frills
first look from previous versions.  It's only on version 0.17,[2]
but it's a careful balance between simplicity, performance,
(fun) features, applications, and ease of customization.  The
number of themes they have on freshmeat is amazing. [3] After
less than an hour or two of "nesting" I already have almost
all my menus and controls setup just the way I want. 
I definitely recommend this to any Irix desktop holdouts.  It's
a great way to refresh your machine SGI without having to bite the
bullet and rebuild it as a Linux machine.

More articles that support my fantasy that Irvine is the
center of the universe.  We've got the corner on electric
cars, fuel cells, two types of Nobel winning physics,
outside the box computer science, and lot of creative writers.
UCI's creative writing department has been in the 
news a lot over the course of the last decade.  Some
quotes from the article[1]:
   "In 1992, Newsweek called UCI's fiction writing workshop
    'the hottest writing program in the country.' Now it's
    exponentially hotter, thanks only in part to Sebold's daring
    and uncannily timely novel. 
The novel they are talking about is Alice Sebold's "The
Lovely Bones" which is on the way to the top of the 
NY Times best-sellers list.  My uncle used to tease me
about UCI (being a USC graduate from '54) that nobody
knew who UC Irvine was just two states over.  In fact,
I used to refer to UCI as one of the lesser known UC
schools, and when I went off to college in 1985, my
relatives told everyone I was off to Cal State Irvine. 
I took a class as an undergrad by one of the department's 
faculty called "the art of writing fiction".   If there
was ever any two classes that helped contributed to writing
my dissertation, it was that one which taught me how to
get the writing flowing and my high school typing class
which taught me how to type really fast.  
One of the advantages they cite in the article is that they
seem to take a chance on the "not-so-sure" bet, but according
to the article, the number of UCI graduates that have gone on
to write best sellers and the handful that feed the film industry
is creating a viscious cycle that lures more talent which
creates the right writing ecosystem, which churns out more
success stories which lures more talent.

executive and management positions in the major French firms and the
government, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not
officially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws
and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. 
Even for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them
from branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many
can leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about
the French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about
it (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect
this may hold true for other European countries as well.  
After all those "revolutions", France is still nothing more than a
thinly veiled old-school aristocracy, with all the trappings.

An interesting link courtesy of the Harrow Report: there's no written 
evidence so far that Senator Everett Dirksen is the source of the 
infamous quote attributed to him. It's kind of astounding that there is 
enough general social consensus (25% of all queries makes it a *very* 
FAQ) and "eyewitness" reporting without a single written source. What 
the essay below doesn't seem to answer, though, is what the earliest 
attributed quote in print by any other writer is. I'd naturally be much 
more skeptical if the "quote" emerged after his death... RK
"A billion here, a billion there . . ."
Did Dirksen ever say, " A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon 
you're talking real money"? (or anything very close to that?)
Perhaps not. Based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio 
records of The Dirksen Congressional Center, staffers there have found 
no evidence that Dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to 
Archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics 
showing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote 
or its variations.
Here is what they examined: all of the existing audio tapes of the famed 
"Ev and Charlie" and "Ev and Jerry" shows, all newspapers clippings in 
the Dirksen Papers, about 12,500 pages of Dirksen's own speech notes, 
transcripts of his speeches and media appearances, transcripts of 
Republican leadership press conferences, and Dirksen's statements on the 
Senate floor as documented in the Congressional Record.
Although Dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech, preferring to 
rely on notes, he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular 
turn of phrase. For example, in referring to the public debt or 
excessive government spending, Dirksen would jot the word "pothole" to 
remind him to tell the following story, on this occasion in reference to 
the debt ceiling:
"As I think of this bill, and the fact that the more progress we make 
the deeper we go into the hole, I am reminded of a group of men who were 
working on a street. They had dug quite a number of holes. When they got 
through, they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to 
the hole, and they had a nice little mound, which was quite a traffic 
"Not knowing what to do with it, they sat down on the curb and had a 
conference. After a while, one of the fellows snapped his fingers and 
said, ‘I have it. I know how we will get rid of that overriding earth 
and remove the hazard. We will just dig the hole deeper.'" 
[Congressional Record, June 16, 1965, p. 13884].
On the same occasion, Dirksen relied on yet another "spending" story, 
one he labeled "cat in the well":
"One time in the House of Representatives [a colleague] told me a story 
about a proposition that a teacher put to a boy. He said, ‘Johnny, a cat 
fell in a well 100 feet deep. Suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and 
then fell back 2 feet. How long would it take the cat to get out of the 
"Johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a 
while, and then when the teacher came down and said, ‘How are you 
getting along?' Johnny said, ‘Teacher, if you give me another slate and 
a couple of slate pencils, I am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes 
I can land that cat in hell.'
"If some people get any cheer our of a $328 billion debt ceiling, I do 
not find much to cheer about concerning it." [Congressional Record, June 
16, 1965, p. 13884].
But there are no such reminders for the "A billion here, a billion 
there . . . " tag line as there surely should have been given Dirksen's 
note-making tendencies. He spoke often and passionately about the debt 
ceiling, federal spending, and the growth of government. Yet there is no 
authoritative reference to the "billion" phrase.
The chief evidence in support of Dirksen making the statement comes from 
people who claim to have heard him. The Library of Congress, for 
example, cites someone's personal observation on the campaign trail as 
evidence. The Dirksen Center has received calls from people who heard 
Dirksen say those words, some even providing the date of the event. But 
cross-checking that information with the records has, so far, turned up 
nothing in the way of confirmation.
The closest documented statement came at a joint Senate-House Republican 
leadership press conference on March 8, 1962, when Dirksen said, "The 
favorite sum of money is $1 billion – a billion a year for a fatter 
federal payroll, a billion here, a billion there." [EMD Papers, 
Republican Congressional Leadership File, f. 25] But the "and pretty 
soon you're talking real money" is missing.
In another close call, the New York Times, January 23, 1961, quoted 
Dirksen: "Look at education – two-and-one-half billion – a billion for 
this, a billion for that, a billion for something else. Three to five 
billion for public works. You haven't got any budget balance left. 
You'll be deeply in the red." [Cited in Byron Hulsey's "Everett Dirksen 
and the Modern Presidents," Ph.D. dissertation (May 1998, University of 
Texas, p. 226]
Of course, the Dirksen Papers do not document completely the late 
Senator's comments. For example, The Center that bears his name does not 
have his testimony before committees. Their collection of Congressional 
Records ends in 1965, omitting the last four years of Dirksen's life and 
career – he might have employed the phrase only late, although witnesses 
claim he said it throughout his career. Dirksen's campaign speeches 
tended not to produce transcripts, only sketchy notes or abbreviated 
newspaper accounts. Dirksen also held center stage before the video age, 
meaning that many remarks, particularly those in campaigns, escaped 
Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have 
endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he 
ever coined it.

feet from Wellesley and Jarvis or Queen and Spadina, you're in

every conceivable problem (and problems you didn't conceive of) recovers
to a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is a
design/programming issue.
That said, we usually prototype serious systems in Java and then
re-implement them in C if we have time.  Java doesn't scale well as a
language for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered. 
The problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairly
detailed and low-level control of system resources to get around
bottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don't give
you access to it.  You can squeeze several times the performance out of
a C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune
(or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management. 
Nonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications you
could conceivably develop in either language, as most aren't limited by
raw performance scalability.

a pathological manner.  Code reuse is wonderful and all that, but
libraries frequently make design trade-offs that won't work for me even

particularly easy nor does it make a nice simple API to design a library

I envy some of those posting to this list.  I've been in business for
24 years and I haven't yet had the luxury of writing every line of
code for any project. We are always coerced by budgets and time to
maximize the amount of work done elsewhere.  
As much as I hate dealing with someone else's blackbox, as much as
I've spent sleepless nights second-guessing external libs, I've never
ever had the luxury to do otherwise. It must be wonderful to be
responsible for something you are actually responsible for, and I am
so sick of being blamed for other people's design mistakes.
Maybe there's an archive somewhere I need to know about, but I've been
using C since DrDobbs first published SmallC and yet I've never found
any decent LGPL libs cataloged in such a way that I can just type in
the task and get back an API.  Because of Javadoc, which is by no
means perfect, Java provides me the second best catalog of 3rd-party
libs, second only to Perl's CPAN -- Perl is one language I also really
hate with a passion, yet end up using the most for exactly this reason.
For example, take the recent CBC Olympics site: I needed to roll
together a telnet client with a tokenizer, perl-regex preprocessing a
stream to produce parseable XML, project that XML into relational
databases using only the DTD to generate the rdbms schema, and open an
XMLRPC interface to read and post items into the news stream.  Where
can I find C libs for those components?  
On the webserver, we then needed a multithreaded read-only http socket
which can spawn persistent data-caching servlets that periodically
refresh themselves over socket connections to the relational database,
presenting the retreived values through XSLT-defined transforms, and
again, where can I find such stuff for C ... or for any other langauge
but Java?  Wombat (servlet spec for Perl) was inviting, but it's not
ready for prime-time, and re-inventing that entire shopping list in C
is just not feasible for one programmer to do inside of 8 weeks.
When you need C libs, or even C++ libs, where's the best place to shop?
Where do you find standards-based portable RDBMS API? (ODBC?) How do
you evaluate these things without actually fetching every one and
trying it out?

Gary's news service at teledyn.com has an article on Internet Saturation.
Let me ask you....If you were on a rock in the middle of the Atlantic, 
mostly in the dark for half the year, wouldn't *you* like a bit of 
internet distraction?   They've already done the obvious and fiber-ringed 
the island.
Latest guestimate stats from Ireland's NUA show a flattening Internet 
population growth. It seems there's two kinds of people, those who will go 
online with the status quo, and those who won't: Canada levels out at 53%, 
the USA at 59% (since 2000!), Denmark flatlines at 60%, Norway at 54%, 
Sweden at 64%, and the UK at 55% ... only Iceland continues unfettered 
beyond 60%. Could this be evidence of a usability barrier? If so, it's a 
clear signal that there's as much fortune to be gained from a 
substantially new Internet interface than all that has been gained so far.

I should note that normally when I've used C or C++ in the past, it's
dictated by the fact that I would be working on a commercial product,
written from the ground up, where the code you're generating is important

option, or would be a PITA licensing-wise.
Also, cutting out third-party dependencies can reduce the risk of "oops,
there goes the company that makes that library I depend on, now to shop
around for something vaguely similar, figure out what bugs it's got,
rewrite my code to use the new API, and hope for the best".

Tech's Major Decline
College Students Turning Away From Bits and Bytes
By Ellen McCarthy
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, August 27, 2002; Page E01
If John Yandziak had been entering college a few years ago, he might have
sought a stake in the "new" economy. He might have dreamed of becoming an
ace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imagined
toppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried to
use the Internet to end world hunger.
But as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboring
different academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to do
something more social and more interesting than working with computers.
Besides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, "you
can't get the chicks with that anymore."
The tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of
some fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the tech
bust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has
come to a halt.
The number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in
2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. And
educators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some
colleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.
The word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickled
into the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association of
Computing Machinery.
"I've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic
declines," said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering
at Princeton University in January. "It can be hard to see this, because at
some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far
exceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect."
At Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science
department will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George Washington
University, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer
science fell by more than half this year.
Interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the
past decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science and
computer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the Computing
Research Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees
were awarded.
The Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the
fastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other
computer-related industries trailing close behind.
But in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among
college students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying
information technology and engineering at George Mason University were
computer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major is
down to 800, although a newly created and more general information
technology major has attracted 200 students.
"Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief," said Lloyd Griffith,
dean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school.
"Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend four
years on something and then not get a job."
Freshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer science major
is expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Maryland
decreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does
not account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College of
Computer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
"We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their
interest in pursuing computer science as a major," Halperin said. "That's a
factual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expect
to see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are no
longer expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off."
Yandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is not
convinced that's the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,
with a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his
advanced-placement exam in computer science.
"All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,
so I looked for professions in which I could use those things," Yandziak
said. "I'm just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. I
want to do something that will contribute to the practical world."
Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,
salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.
"There was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have the
same sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, 'I don't need this
kind of IT training right now,' " Miller said. "Our concern as an industry
is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the
road four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to
find themselves in a shortage situation."
Economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other
factors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social
influences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professional
development at the American College Counseling Association. The perception
of computer science as an isolating, "nerdy" profession is one that many in
the industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground during
the tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.
"All the hipness is gone," Yandziak said. "Once we thought of the Internet
as this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad that
came along."
Lamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in
the District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business
marketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.
"Technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore,"
Thompson said. "To be honest with you, when I think computer science, I
think of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It's a
necessity, but I wouldn't take it any further."

I was really looking forward to being able to use a better language like

With the increasing prevalence of web services (not that they are always a

the Java application layer for long... Recent threads here on Fork
indicating the move towards hardware parsing or this code even become part

Sunday I drove from Portland down to the Woodburn Dragstrip to check out 
The electric cars, motorcycles and dragsters had some great times and I 
ended up with a few pics and a nice deep burn...
John Waylan (who was interviewed in Wired a few years back) pulled out a 
14.4 second run in the quarter mile (91mph), on a battery pack that 
hasn't been broken in yet. He expects to break his record next year 
topping his 13.1sec/99mph run a couple of years ago. He's shooting for a 
12 second run.
John also took out a replica 1908 Oldsmobile for a respectable 47mph 
run. (Remember, we started out with electric cars.)
Near the end of the day, Kilacycle took the track with an amazing 111mph 
run. Talk about a crotch rocket.

Well, unfortunately, I appear to be using a window manager that doesn't 
support the icon window.
However, I did fix some bugs in the related "Hide When Empty" functionality 
which may solve the issue.  You may need to remove "unseen" from the "always 
show sequences" to make this work.  If so, let me know so I can put that in 
the help window for "Icon Window" as it already is for "Hide When Empty".

Thanks Tony, but I think doing it using component files will get a .signature 
by default, but I have many diferent signatures and I want to insert one of 
that signatures using a keyboard command. So for a message I will insert a 
signature, but for another message I will insert a different signature.
Is it possible? I am using sedit for my messages.

  | hmmm, I assume you're going to report this to the nmh folks?
Yes, I will, sometime, after I look at the nmh sources and see what
they have managed to break, and why.
But we really want exmh to operate with all the versions of nmh that
exist, don't we?   The patch to have exmh do the right thing, whether this
bug exists, or not, is trivial, so I'd suggest including it.
Patch follows ...
I have no idea why the sequences were being added after the message list
before, not that it should make any difference to nmh (or MH).   But since
I stopped doing that, the variable "msgs" isn't really needed any more,
rather than assigning $pick(msgs) to msgs, and then using $msgs the code
could just use $pick(msgs) where $msgs is now used.   This is just a
frill though, so I didn't change that.

Something like that is quite possible, but perviously typing nonsense

from the sequence code...
Perviously this would have just caused red messages in the status

should keep on doing (the "red" part isn't important obviously..)

Thanks for this information.  I gave Alsa a try, couldn't figure out how
to enable digital out, although I'm sure if I put enough time into it,
could have gotten it working.  Also when playing mp3s in analog mode,
every time I switched between mp3s there was a bit of static.  Noticed a
new distribution geared towards audio applications, AGNULA
open source emu10k1 drivers (SBLive! 5.1) work fair enough.  Anyone else
experience these problems with Alsa?  Are there alot of people on this
list using Alsa?

Making a mesh on the move
A new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, 
reports Peter Rojas
Peter Rojas
Thursday August 29, 2002
The Guardian
Imagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from 
anywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting 
for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or 
download the MP3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes.
This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the 
third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for 
years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new 
technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision 
sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever 
Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, 
are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. 
Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, 
with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time 
"mesh-enabled" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close 
proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh 
network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying 
traffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it 
reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central 
antennas, and improving wireless coverage.
As the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and 
other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless 
networking may be inevitable.
Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless 
networks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users 
connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a 
dial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection 
speeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The 
technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed 
wireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range 
protocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even 
faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.
The range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of 
much use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the 
problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. 
Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, 
because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, 
connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless 
Because mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed 
to create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building 
cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all 
that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around 
£100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the 
proper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by 
It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. 
Unlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on 
is unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too 
pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds 
acquiring 3G licences.
All that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect 
to the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets 
better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone 
But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have 
high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, 
and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing 
music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When 
UltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.
At 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the 
person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. 
Sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of 
their favourite songs, movies, and video games.
But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. 
MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. 
Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities 
that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works 
employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the 
cheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for 
enterprise networks.
The first place average users may use the technology is when it is 
incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at 
high speeds, which both companies see happening soon.
When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in 
your pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service 
was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually 
someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.

You dont use batteries for a 1/4 mile run, you use capacitors. MANY times

the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run
anyway, just like a gas dragster is refueled, so this wouldnt be cheating.

No, even best supercapacitors are a long way to go from reasonably good 
electrochemical energy sources. But you can recharge and discharge them 
very quickly, and they take lots more of cycles than the best battery. 
Ideal for absorbing the braking energy and turn them into smoking tires 
few moments or minutes afterwards.
I don't see any reason why EVs shouldn't dominate dragster runs. The
traction is the limiting factor, not motor power. You can basically put
the motors into wheelhubs mounted on a composite frame, and dump juice
into them until they melt, which will be some 100 sec downstream. Plenty
of time to smoke anything.
Of course, it doesn't roar, and spew smokage, so it won't happen.

Secure and at ease
By Jack Mccarthy

MAX LEVCHIN'S FASCINATION with encryption started when he was a teenager 
in Kiev, Ukraine, and continued as he immigrated to the United States 
where he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 
late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to 
co-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens 
of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet 
transaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his 
company for a king's ransom.
Not bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.
A programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to 
Chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a 
mission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure 
passwords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded 
PayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the 
"This company was founded on the notion of security value," Levchin 
says. "Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning."
Thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains 
focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good 
"I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction 
processor," Levchin says. "We spend a lot of time designing security so 
it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. 
The trade-off is fundamental."
Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with 
e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, 
accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The 
service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and 
more than 3 million business accounts.
Most of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led 
PayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. 
Although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two 
companies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition 
of PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.
Levchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. "There are

Of course we've had select() since BSD 4.2 and poll() since System V
or so, and they work reasonably well for asynchronous I/O up to a
hundred or so channels, but suck after that; /dev/poll (available in
Solaris and Linux) is one approach to solving this; Linux has a way to
do essentially the same thing with real-time signals, and has for
years; and FreeBSD has kqueue.
More details about these are at
None of this helps with disk I/O; most programs that need to overlap
disk I/O with computation, on either proprietary Unixes or Linux, just
use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I/O.
POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that most
proprietary Unixes implement.  The Linux kernel hackers are currently
rewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch to
work asynchronously, because they can easily build efficient
synchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the other
way around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too.
It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg saying
things like "Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any
idea at all how the hardware functions," but he's totally off-base.
People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, but
apparently some don't, so I'll rebut.
Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than the
original stupid errors.
In detail, he wrote:
Unix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 years
ago, and Solaris has had the particular aio_* calls we are discussing
for many years.  Very few applications need the aio_* calls ---
essentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them
at all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with
multiple threads or processes.  This just provides a modicum of extra
Readers can judge who lacks the clue here.
Although I don't have a copy of the spec handy, I think the aio_* APIs
come from the POSIX spec IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is
13 years old, and which I think documented then-current practice.
They might be even older than that.
Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations
have supported multithreading for a decade or more.
Linux's aio_* routines can notify the process of their completion with
a "signal", a feature missing in Microsoft Windows; a "signal" causes
the immediate execution of a "signal handler" in a process.  By
contrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such
as completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process
polls them.
I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case
(although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the
technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards.
Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous
network I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal
queue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo().

This capacitor drive idea isn't completely stupid, but neither is it well
thought out.
called ultracapacitors.  They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage
regulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly
the energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16
kilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic
energy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in
a vacuum.
Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8
kw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) --  and punch it through an electric motor.  How much does
the 64 hp electric motor weigh?  If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet
it isn't -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph --
the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored
electrically in the capacitor.  And it's not at all obvious that the torque
vs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do
it without wheels, drive train, etc.
But if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag!
On to the Lunarnationals?  Or would you prefer the bite of donut?

EPA: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer
Wed Sep 4, 3:29 AM ET
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other
sources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection
Agency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.
The EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's
push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines
and diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.
While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of
exposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both
animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer
risk to humans.
"It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental
exposure levels" as well, the report said. "The potential human health
effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and
uncertainties are involved."
The report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various
world health agencies and studies in California and is particularly
significant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel
emissions under the Clean Air Act.
Some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush
administration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that
would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a
separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.
EPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with
the tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,
the EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone
the requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to
meet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.
The engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,
although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel
is expected to produce pollution reductions.
The EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the
probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to
diesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when
gauging pollution health concerns.
But in this case, the report said, "the exposure-response data are
considered too uncertain" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of
cancer risk to an individual.
Nevertheless, said the report, the "totality of evidence from human, animal
and other supporting studies" suggests that diesel exhaust "is likely to be
carcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to
environmental exposure."
The report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses
short-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a
"chronic respiratory hazard to humans" contributing to increased asthma and
other respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for
as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.
Environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs
to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road
diesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency
expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust
sources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.
Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private
environmental organization, said: "To reduce the public's exposure to
harmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement
clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent
standards for diesel construction and farm equipment."
Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology
Forum, said the EPA's report "focused on the past," whereas "the future is
clean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times
cleaner than just a dozen years ago."
The report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in
the mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow
turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.

Hindus mourn 'monkey god'
By Omer Farooq
BBC reporter in Hyderabad
Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became
revered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indian
state of Andhra Pradesh.
The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed
Animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion
after being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers.
The animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles)
south of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday.
It had not eaten for three weeks.
Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in
the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the
monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman.
One animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had
failed because of the blind faith of the people.
The monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal
out of the temple, but were prevented by villagers.
The monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month
ago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages,
as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka.
Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it
around the clock.
Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, as
the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of
But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being
They filed a petition in the state's High Court saying the monkey had been
forcibly confined in the temple.
The group also alleged that people's religious feelings were being
exploited to make money.
The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - but
villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.

So, like many young children, my daughter Tatum (age 21 months) *really*
likes music. She also likes to have control over her environment, and this
means she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and getting
the music playing.
By watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design
from watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market
niche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player.
The CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but
doesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead
requiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI
disaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the
button again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever
get music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a
surprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again
when the music doesn't play.
For toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately,
within half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the
button multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't
change the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you
press, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be
the same.
The back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI
disaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angle
CDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn't much of a
problem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge,
that edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces and
wiggles the CD out, a process that's hard on the CD and the player (but
which hasn't yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, it
hasn't been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems to
understand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides the
Tatum's CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this is
a mistake. Tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put the
player into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressing
the play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song,
but uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono and
FM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands the
binary distinction of music/no music.
What would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately start
playing a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, it
would give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button.
The other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least half
the size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so
there is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play.
The play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of
the player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. The
device would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flip
open at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. It
should be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2'
without affecting the player.

Get Sexier, Keep Husbands, Mayor Tells Wives
Wed Sep 4, 9:14 AM ET
MISSAGLIA, Italy (Reuters) - Husband's eyes wandering? Make yourself sexier.
At least that's the solution proposed by an Italian mayor -- and a woman
mayor at that.
Wives in the northern town of Missaglia had complained to mayor Marta
Casiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace.
They complained that the men in the town of some 7,000 people were spending
too much time ogling, so they asked Casiraghi to order the woman to put her
clothes back on.
But the mayor, far from sympathizing, told the wives to get sexy if they
wanted to keep their men. "The girl was very pretty and was soaking up some
sun. Topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays.
There's nothing we can do," Casiraghi told Il Nuovo, a web-based newspaper.
"Instead, I'd advise the wives to play their rival at her own game -- make
themselves more beautiful."

As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK not

have been a few attempts to explain his heightened reflexes, from the 
biological to hidden methamphetamine use, but none seem to do the spidey

presence of well concealed weapons and even sense evil-doers while they 
were in their street clothes. Perhaps the spidey senses are the result 
of some sort of quantum entanglement?

Could this be as simple as a modified molecular structure where the
humanoid cells are in fact exo-skeletally structured with more atoms
per cubic angstrom to achieve the distance-squared tensile strength
enhancements we find when we introduce smaller metal atoms between the
lattice packed grid of iron atoms to create steel?  
This 'steel-effect' might give bone structure and tendons dramatically
(several orders of magnitude) more tensile strength without the need
to significantly increase the weight (like magnesium-alloy or
carbon-fiber weight compared to iron, Spidey could even be way under
weight).  Only increasing tensile strength could accommodate the
mobility and leverage feats since bones are actually formed from
bubbles of organic material hydrolically assisted, tensile strength
cross-sectionally would give his frame the strength to withstand the
muscular enhancement.
If the same close-packing gap-filling arachne-molecular structure
modification occurs in neural tissues, and there'd be no reason to
think that these would grow differently from bones and tendons, then
what we are seeing in spidey sense is no more than the heightened
cerebral functions due to shorter/faster/stronger synapses throughout
the entire nervous system.  
Since we know dogs and cats measure human emotions by smell, clearly
hearing the heartbeats, and other subtle clues within their normal
sensory ranges (but seem mystical to us) ...  for Peter Parker,
everything from air currents on his facial-hairs to extremely subtle
hormone smells might coallesce into a general gestalt of Spidey-Sense;
don't forget that he'd acquired this ability in adolescence and thus
would lack any cultural or even pathological basis to explain the
heightened awareness to himself in anything but mystical terms. We
know from issue #1 that his collision-avoidance reflex response time
was far swifter than his cognitive awareness since he 'found' himself
already stuck to the tree when the bicycle was already past and hence
his disorientation ("You ok, Mister?") as if it was a hallucination.
Hmmm ... it may even be physio-psychologically interesting to examine
if Peter Parker's personal quandries arose _because_ his physiological
'Spidey' infrastructure had been advanced whereas his psychological
perception of his self had not, ie, "Peter" was not "Spiderman" but
just the "driver of the bus".  Only, unlike ourselves, he found his
self driving a body-vehicle not evolutionarily matched to his
cognitive time-scales.

You could also take the CD out while it is "playing".
Hmm. If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don't

Sony makes such a line of products.
My father was legendary for his abilty to break things.  His 'thumbs of death'
would rival anything a toddler could do to devices.  After countless numbers of
Walkman devices having their lids broken or buttons pressed into oblivion I
found the Sony devices.  I got him a "My First Sony" (be afraid of the
marketing) CD player.   It was /fire engine red/ but was completely
indestructible.  I hacked a headphone jack into it and gave it to him.  He
complained of it's looks but used it nonetheless.  I also gave him a pack of
headphones as there's no such things indestuctible headphones that aren't
obscenely bulky.
Now that we're riding up the curve of an ever increasing geezer population, how
soon before device makers get wise?  Not to be morbid, but would the marketing

I dunno, BB.  Women who like to be thought of this way should have the 
right to choose to be treated this way.  Men too...  ahem.  (:  My boy 
cleans, washes clothes, cooks, fixes stuff, etc, and works the same number 
of hours I do, sometimes more, if he has to catch up with me.  (:  I 
close him because he is industrious and creative, and because he 
unfailingly makes my bed the minute I get out of it.  And boy #2 will be 
here soon to help boy #1 with other things such as pedicures,  backrubs, 
and sure, fucking.  LOL! (along with the aforementioned "chores") Adam can 
have his cake and eat it too, if he can only find the right girl who has 
the same beliefs about gender  roles that he has. Of course, he has NO 
clue where to look, so we will be constantly laughing at him while he 
stumbles around in the dark.  
P.S. the numbers do not in any way indicate importance or favor -- only 
the order in which they move into my house.  -smiles at chris-
P.S. #2.  I'm moving.   Going to New Orleans.  Can't handle any more cab 
driving.  The summer sucked here on the MS Gulf Coast, instead of rocking 
like it normally does.  Wish me luck.  I'm going to look for another

You assume that they just match people up and marry them off, and neither is
attracted to the other, which is not the case. Even this has arranged

Males gets: A wife for a while, and if they actually like each other, for a
long time.
Female gets: Into Britan, out of a country with no real rights for women, no
opportunities for her or her children, out of the polution, AIDS, and an
uncountable number of scary tropical diseases. Not to mention in most cases
living conditions that us spoiled Americans cannot even comprehend.

The point --- my point, the point I was discussing; please don't try

hasn't been without this feature, and in fact has had it since you
were in elementary school, and operating systems without it don't
"totally suck for nontrivial apps".
For what it's worth, glibc has actually implemented the aio_* calls
for a while, just in a way that doesn't scale to large numbers of
concurrent I/O requests.  I find references to the glibc
implementation as far back as 1999 and glibc 2.1.1, and I could
probably find much earlier references if I had time:

Your original complaint was that Unix didn't do multithreading or
multiprogramming well.  Now that I've pointed out how obviously
idiotic that claim is, you've amended your complaint: now, although
individual Unixes do these things well, you complain that their
implementations are not entirely conformant with the POSIX threads
specification.  Well, that's probably true, but I haven't written
pthreads programs in C much myself, so I can't confirm it from my own
experience.  But, even if it's true, it's not a very good reason to
prefer Windows.
I'm sure you can provide examples of bugs in particular threading
implementations.  Spare us.  Just shut up.

And how is this any different from "normal" marriage exactly? Other then
that the woman not only gets a man, but one in a country where both she and
her offspring will have actual opportunities? Oh and the lack of

Mmkay.  For the nth time Adam, we don't live in the land of
Adam-fantasy.  Women actually are allowed to do things productive,
independent and entirely free of their male counterparts.  They aren't
forced to cook and clean and merely be sexual vessels.   Sometimes,
and this will come as a shock to you, no doubt, men and women even
find -love- (which is the crucial distinction between this system) and
they marry one another for the satisfaction of being together.   I
know, far-fetched and idealistically crazy as it is, but such things
do happen.   I can guarantee you, if my mother was approached by my
father, and 25 years ago, he commented on her cleaning ability as a
motivator for marrying her, we would not be having this conversation
If guys still have silly antequated ideas about 'women's role' then
their opportunities for finding women _will_ be scarce.   Again, these
situations are great, provided everyone is aware that the relationship
is a contractual one -- he wants a maid, a dog and a prostitute he
doesn't have to pay, and she wants a country that isn't impoverished
and teeming with AIDS.  A contract, versus a true love-interest
Egh.  I really need to stop analyzing your posts to this extent.   I

This guy's an idiot.
I design loads for systems with the 50 kV capacitors.  One of those has 864
of such capacitors and stores only 10 megajoules, which means 11 kilojoules
each.  They weigh 125 kg.
You need high energy per unit mass, and the capacitive system I picked
maximizes that.
It is precisely the system that Maxwell is touting for electrical braking
and power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles.  You also need
voltage you can use in a DC motor, which is why though the actual
capacitors in the system are charged to 2.5 volts, the system has them
arranged in series to boost the voltage.

Since the energy you can pack into a capacitor is something like

accelerating insects, not cars. That must be why 40kV is standard not 42.
(the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW)
Most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few
real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were
talking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the "capactior is the
wrong choice" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one,
it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady
discharge curve.
But it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not
the 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those
you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole
atoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with
a fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel,
and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.

Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand
Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET
By Andrew Marshall
BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand
looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her.
"The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all
my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous," he said. "I
knew then there was something special."
Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet
-- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,
who is expecting their first child.
Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women
in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that
often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand
in search of a wife.
"I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan," he said. "I knew I
found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring."
Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in
touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and
the couple married.
MR. MARRIAGE
Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency
Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself "Mr. Marriage,"
started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction
Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.
"In the last five years we've done about 400," he said. "To the best of my
knowledge, they have all been successful."
Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that
require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.
Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women
looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.
Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's
office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and
language problems.
"We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,"
Lynch said. "But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax."
After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know
each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every
client has found a potential wife.
"At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and
think he hasn't made his mind up," he said. In most cases, marriage follows,
usually within the next year.
Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a
Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less
than 10 percent have broken up.
Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just
arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.
"Sometimes they are very nervous," she said. "And sometimes they are very
impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm
down, OK, we'll talk."'
But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife
and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives
for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic
stress disorder.
Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics
say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to
form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of
impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.
But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is
no reason to object. "If you talk about people who are needy, I think
everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I
need Wan," he said.
"Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no
secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem
with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to
their future husband."
Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they
choose to use his agency.
His brochure promises an alternative to the "kind of de-feminized,
over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British
singles scene," and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are
not "God's gift to women."
Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their
own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.
"They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques
or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?
Impossible," she said.
"Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are
good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from
ladies from other countries."
Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,
the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also
not a major obstacle.
"Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having
a husband who is significantly older," Lynch said. "When I met my wife she
couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic
dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up
very quickly."
Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move
to the West.
"We have kitchens, we have study classes," Roongthip said. "We teach them
how to eat, and when to make tea."
But not all dreams come true. "Bee" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to
Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is
back in Bangkok, sad and angry.
"He had no friends, and I was so lonely," she said. "I tried to make him
happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never
spoke to me."
Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. "I thought I would be happy
there," she said. "But it was the worst time of my life."
Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure
unsuitable candidates are weeded out.
"We are ethical and professional," he said. "We will not take on all
Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the
arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,
looking for a foreign husband.
"Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,"
Moylan said. "But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal."

What is silly and antiquated depends a lot on which country you live in.
I don't have statistics on the love half life, but it seems long-term 
relationships use something else for glue.
Clearly our non-silly non-antiquated ideas about relationships have
resulted in mostly short-duration relationships and single-parented,
dysfunctional kids (not enough of them too boot, so to keep our
demographics from completely keeling over we're importing them from places
with mostly silly and antiquated ideas).
At least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and
counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we're doing
something wrong.
Maybe we should really go dirty Tleilaxu all the way.
i agree with rob. i think if the phones (and mms is building traction in europe in handsets), this might be interesting. bottom line is will it a) help sell phones and b) bill enough time on the wcarriers networks?
anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad? low quality, small in size. but kids totally dug that stuff. seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point. and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs. i don't think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography - developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc. i think it expands the market and forms a new category. the extent of the category size is the big question (will it be a fad or will it a sustained market). that's consumer behavior and marketing. but i don't think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market (in this case, digital photos or normal photos). europe's the one to watch - more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right, they'll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them.

LOL!  They're not doomed at all.  Thousands of men wear cb2000s to work 
every day (along with other chastity devices).    They are not just 
decorations.  You will not get a woody or have an orgasm until your 
keyholder allows you to.  Anyhow, I know better than to have this 
type of conversation with a 'nilla, but these men wear these happily, and 
consensually.  (:  There is little power struggle in the lifestyles of the 
people who use these.  There is power exchange instead.  Lots of 
variations on the definition, but this one's from Gloria Brame's site:
Power exchange: the consensual transfer of power by the submissive to the 
dominant. The exchange takes place when the returned energy from the 
dominant empowers the submissive. 
Anyhow, there are tons of informative sites out there for anyone who cares 
to read them, but I assure you, the chastity device business is doing very 
well, and it is illegal to force someone to wear one.  It's not coercion, 
it is creative sensuality.  (:
