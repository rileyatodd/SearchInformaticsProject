His reports appear on all platforms of NBC News, including “Nightly News with Brian Williams,” “TODAY,” “Meet the Press,” “Dateline,” MSNBC, and NBCNews.com.</p><p>Engel, one of the only western journalists to cover the entire war in Iraq, joined NBC News in May 2003. He previously worked as a freelance journalist for ABC News, most notably during the initial U.S. invasion of Iraq. He remained in Baghdad as NBC's primary Iraq correspondent until his appointment as senior Middle East correspondent and Beirut bureau chief in May 2006. Engel also covered the war between Israel and Hezbollah in the summer of 2006 from Beirut and southern Lebanon.  </p><p>Prior to working for ABC News, Engel served as the Middle East correspondent for \"The World,\" a joint production of BBC World Service, Public Radio International (PRI) and WGBH-Boston radio from 2001-2003.

Since taking over as anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News in 2004, he has strengthened the broadcast's position as the most-watched newscast in all of television and has become the most highly decorated evening news anchor of the modern era. He has received eleven Edward R. Murrow Awards, twelve Emmy Awards, the duPont-Columbia University Award, the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism and the industry’s highest honor, the George Foster Peabody Award.</p><p>Williams began his broadcasting career in 1981 at KOAM-TV in Pittsburg, Kan. He worked at several local stations in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City before joining NBC News in 1993. He became NBC’s chief White House correspondent and then anchor and managing editor of \"The News With Brian Williams\" on MSNBC and CNBC. </p><p>In 2004, he took over as anchor of \"NBC Nightly News,\" the nation’s top-rated nightly news program, a distinction it has maintained throughout Williams’ tenure in the anchor chair. Two years later, Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. </p><p>In 2011, NBC News launched \"Rock Center with Brian Williams,\" the network’s first new primetime newsmagazine in nearly two decades. </p><p>Williams’ coverage of world events has earned him high praise and several citations for journalistic excellence, many of which were awarded for his work covering Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. The New York Tims said his reporting of Katrina was “a defining moment,” and Vanity Fair later called his work “Murrow-worthy” and reported that during the crisis he became “a nation’s anchor.” He has covered numerous presidential campaigns, nominating conventions, and elections, and has moderated eight presidential debates. </p><p>Williams is a native of Middletown, N.J. where he was a firefighter for several years. Before his start in broadcasting, Williams worked in the White House during the Carter administration, beginning as an intern. He later worked as assistant administrator of the political action committee of the National Association of Broadcasters in Washington. He attended Brookdale Community College, Catholic University and George Washington University, and is a member of the Board of Directors of the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation.</p>","name":"Brian Williams ","picture":{"credit":null,"caption":"Image: Brian Williams Byline Photo","url":"http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2014_04/126906/140120-brian-williams-byline_c1bb4c3dae95acb207d36bf283e99dea.jpg","width":1500,"height":1500}}],"first_published_utc":"2014-12-13 01:55:29 Z","last_published_utc":"2014-12-13 01:55:29 Z","sections":[{"title":"3RD Block","slug":"3rd-block"},{"title":"Nightly News","slug":"nightly-news"}],"topics":[],"feature":[{"title":"3RD Block","slug":"3rd-block"}],"show":[],"storyline":[],"tags":[],"labels":[],"id":"NewsCms/Entry/267636","externalId":"267636","externalSource":"NewsCms","main_art":{"caption":null,"url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/nn_bwi_3blk_cloudcanyon_141212.jpg","credit":null,"source":null,"alt_text":null,"width":0,"height":0},"taxons":[{"slug":"3rd-block","type":"Section","title":"3RD Block","topics":[]},{"slug":"nightly-news","type":"Section","title":"Nightly News","topics":[]}]}]}
