Usually, the government issues at least three versions of the GDP, but last year, the figure was revised all the way back to 1929. Watch this video, reported with CNBC’s Jeff Cox to learn why.

                    Every time the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences hands out another Oscar, they do more than honor an artist or a producer for their achievement in filmmaking. They also add a new data point to rich set of statistics going back to the first awards ceremony, in 1928. With over 80 entries in the Best Picture category, NBC News decided to look back at all of the past winners to determine what, if anything, the top films had in common. The average length is 139 minutes, with the all-time record holder, “Gone with the Wind” clocking in at 238 minutes. “Gone With the Wind” might be the prototypical best picture because it shares a lot with the other winners: it’s a romance, set in the past, based on a book. More than two-thirds of all winners take their inspiration from a book or play, and if you expand the definition of adaptation to include real-world events (like this year’s nominee, “American Hustle”), the number jumps almost as high as the percentage of winning dramas.
