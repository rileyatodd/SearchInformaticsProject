The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share common themes. When something is private to a <i>person<\/i>, it usually means there is something to them inherently special or sensitive. The domain of privacy partially overlaps security, including for instance the concepts of appropriate use, as well as protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity.<\/p>\n<p>The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the government, corporations or individuals is part of many countries' privacy laws, and in some cases, constitutions. Almost all countries have laws which in some way limit privacy. An example of this would be law concerning taxation, which normally require the sharing of information about personal income or earnings. In some countries individual privacy may conflict with freedom of speech laws and some laws may require public disclosure of information which would be considered private in other countries and cultures.<\/p>\n<p>Privacy may be voluntarily sacrificed, normally in exchange for perceived benefits and very often with specific dangers and losses, although this is a very strategic view of human relationships. In the business world, a person may volunteer personal details (often for advertising purposes) in order to gamble on winning a prize. Personal information which is voluntarily shared but subsequently stolen or misused can lead to identity theft.<\/p>\n<p>The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern construct associated with Western culture, British and North American in particular, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times. According to some researchers, this concept sets Anglo-American culture apart even from Western European cultures such as French or Italian. Most cultures, however, recognize the ability of individuals to withhold certain parts of their personal information from wider society - a figleaf over the genitals being an ancient example.<\/p>\n<p>The word \"privacy\" is an example of an untranslatable lexeme, and many languages do not have a specific word for \"privacy\". Such languages either use a complex description to translate the term (such as Russian combining the meaning of <i>уединение<\/i> - solitude, <i>секретность<\/i> - secrecy, and <i>частная жизнь<\/i> - private life) or borrow from English \"privacy\" (as Indonesian <i>Privasi<\/i> or Italian <i>la privacy<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Privacy\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2011-06-14T06:21:30","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Privacy","item_count":255,"category":"Topic","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":1,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=41020","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/41020\/","daily_count":3,"id":41020,"name":"Uber","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/uber\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/uber\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/5b\/Delorean_DMC-12_Time_Machine_in_San_Francisco.JPG","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:55:57.026965","active":true,"links":"","kind":"tag","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Kpm","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=41020","latitude":null,"slug":"uber","description":"<p><b>Uber<\/b> is a ridesharing service based in San Francisco.

Engineering is the discipline that seeks to study and design new technologies. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include <i>construction technology<\/i>, <i>medical technology<\/i> and <i>information technology<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology","item_count":7844,"category":"Topic","livevideo":""}],"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/12\/15\/in-letter-uber-says-it-accessed-buzzfeed-news-rep","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bzfd.it\/1xmPs0M","url_domain":"buzzfeed.com","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/12\/15\/in-letter-uber-says-it-accessed-buzzfeed-news-rep","author":{"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","last_name":"Stampher","first_name":"Jillian","email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","is_staff":true,"id":14,"full_name":"Jillian Stampher","username":"jillian.stamper"},"type":"text","whoas":2,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CBxB","push_content":"In letter, Uber says it accessed Buzzfeed News reporter's account information because she was late to meeting - @BuzzFeedNews","content":"In letter, Uber says it accessed Buzzfeed News reporter's account information because she was late to meeting - @BuzzFeedNews","slug":"in-letter-uber-says-it-accessed-buzzfeed-news-rep","importance":2,"note":null,"media":null},{"tweet":null,"url":"","date_ap":"Dec 15, 2014, 11:50 PM GMT","data":null,"submitter":"editor","date":"2014-12-15T23:50:21.097646","status":"published","source":null,"pushed":true,"updated_date":"2014-12-15T23:50:26.594813","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/483537\/","data_type":null,"id":483537,"topics":[{"recent_count":2,"woeid":23424948,"geohash":"w21zf8t5pf84","longitude":103.828,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1016","placetype":"Country","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1016\/","daily_count":2,"id":1016,"name":"Singapore","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/singapore\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/singapore\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/48\/Flag_of_Singapore.svg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:50:21.097646","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/QY","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1016","latitude":1.36558,"slug":"singapore","description":"<p><b>Singapore<\/b> (\/ˈsɪŋəpɔər\/ or \/ˈsɪŋɡəpɔər\/), officially the <b>Republic of Singapore<\/b>, is a sovereign city-state and island country in Southeast Asia. It lies off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula and is 137 kilometres (85 mi) north of the equator. The country's territory consists of the lozenge-shaped main island, commonly referred to as <i>Singapore Island<\/i> in English and Pulau Ujong in Malay, and more than 60 significantly smaller islets. Singapore is separated from Peninsular Malaysia by the Straits of Johor to the north, and from Indonesia's Riau Islands by the Singapore Strait to the south. The country is highly urbanised, and little of the original vegetation remains. The country's territory has consistently expanded through land reclamation.<\/p>\n<p>The islands were settled in the second century AD and subsequently belonged to a series of local empires. Modern Singapore was founded in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles as a trading post of the East India Company with permission from the Johor Sultanate. The British obtained sovereignty over the island in 1824, and Singapore became one of the British Straits Settlements in 1826. Occupied by the Japanese during World War II, Singapore declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1963 and united with other former British territories to form Malaysia, from which it was expelled two years later through a unanimous act of parliament. Since then, Singapore has developed rapidly, earning recognition as one of the Four Asian Tigers.<\/p>\n<p>Singapore is one of the world's major commercial hubs, with the fourth-biggest financial centre and one of the five busiest ports. Its globalised and diversified economy depends heavily on trade, especially manufacturing, which represented 26 percent of Singapore's GDP in 2005. In terms of purchasing power parity, Singapore has the third-highest per capita income in the world but one of the world's highest income inequalities. It places highly in international rankings with regard to education, healthcare, and economic competitiveness. Just over five million people live in Singapore, of which approximately two million are foreign-born. While Singapore is diverse, ethnic Asians predominate: 75 percent of the population is Chinese, with significant minorities of Malays, Indians, and Eurasians. There are four official languages, English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil, and the country promotes multiculturalism through a range of official policies.<\/p>\n<p>Singapore is a unitary multiparty parliamentary republic, with a Westminster system of unicameral parliamentary government. The People's Action Party has won every election since self-government began in 1959.

It has been calculated daily by the <i>Nihon Keizai Shimbun<\/i> (<i>Nikkei<\/i>) newspaper since 1950. It is a price-weighted index (the unit is yen), and the components are reviewed once a year. Currently, the Nikkei is the most widely quoted average of Japanese equities, similar to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In fact, it was known as the \"Nikkei Dow Jones Stock Average\" from 1975 to 1985.<\/p>\n<p>The Nikkei 225 began to be calculated on September 7, 1950, retroactively calculated back to May 16, 1949. Since January 2010 the index is updated every 15 seconds during trading sessions.<\/p>\n<p>The Nikkei 225 Futures, introduced at Singapore Exchange (SGX) in 1986, the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) in 1988, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in 1990, is now an internationally recognized futures index.<\/p>\n<p>The Nikkei average has deviated sharply from the textbook model of stock averages which grow at a steady exponential rate. The average hit its all-time high on December 29, 1989, during the peak of the Japanese asset price bubble, when it reached an intra-day high of 38,957.44 before closing at 38,915.87, having grown sixfold during the decade. Subsequently, it lost nearly all these gains, closing at 7,054.98 on March 10, 2009—81.9% below its peak twenty years earlier.<\/p>\n<p>Another major index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange is the Topix.<\/p>\n<p>On March 15, 2011, the second working day after the massive earthquake in the northeast part of Japan, the index dropped over 10% to finish at 8605.15, a loss of 1,015 points. The index continued to drop throughout 2011, eventually bottoming out at 8160.01 on November 25, putting it at its lowest close since March 10, 2009. The Nikkei fell over 17% in 2011, finishing the year at 8455.35, its lowest year-end closing value in nearly thirty years, when the index finished at 8016.70 in 1982.<\/p>\n<p>The Nikkei started 2013 near 10,600, hitting a peak of 15,942 in May. However, shortly afterward, it plunged by almost 10% before rebounding, making it the most volatile stock market index among the developed markets. In October, 2013, the UK-based hedge fund Algorates, whose strategy is based partially on high-frequency trading, a technique most successful in markets with high volatility, announced major positions in the Nikkei 225. <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nikkei_225\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2011-06-10T20:35:25","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nikkei_225","item_count":478,"category":"MarketIndex","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":8,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":"breakingmoney","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=7","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/7\/","daily_count":31,"id":7,"name":"business","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/business\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/business\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/87\/Downtownplazala.jpg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:55:57.026965","active":true,"links":"","kind":"vertical","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/H","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=7","latitude":null,"slug":"business","description":"<p>A <b>business<\/b>, also known as an <b>enterprise<\/b> or a <b>firm<\/b>, is an organization involved in the trade of goods, services, or both to consumers.

The city is referred to as <b>New York City<\/b> or the <b>City of New York<\/b> to distinguish it from the State of New York, of which it is a part. A global power city, New York exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment. The home of the United Nations Headquarters, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.<\/p>\n<p>On one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a county of New York State. The five boroughs—the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island—were consolidated into a single city in 1898. With a census-estimated 2013 population of 8,405,837 distributed over a land area of just 305 square miles (790 km<sup>2<\/sup>), New York is the most densely populated major city in the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. By 2013 census estimates, the New York City metropolitan region remains by a significant margin the most populous in the United States, as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area (19.9 million residents) and the Combined Statistical Area (23.5 million residents). In 2012, the MSA produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of over US$1.33 trillion, while the CSA generated a GMP of over US$1.55 trillion, both ranking first nationally by a wide margin and behind the GDP of only twelve nations and eleven nations, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>New York traces its roots to its 1624 founding as a trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664. New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. It has been the country's largest city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to America by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a globally recognized symbol of the United States and its democracy.<\/p>\n<p>Many districts and landmarks in New York City have become well known to the city's approximately 55 million annual visitors. Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the world. Times Square, iconified as \"The Crossroads of the World\", is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. The names of many of the city's bridges, skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world. New York City's financial district, anchored by Wall Street in Lower Manhattan, has been called the world's leading financial center and is home to the New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest stock exchange by total market capitalization of its listed companies. Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world. Manhattan's Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere, with multiple signature Chinatowns developing across the city. Providing continuous 24\/7 service, the New York City Subway is one of the most extensive metro systems worldwide, with 468 stations in operation. New York City's higher education network comprises over 120 colleges and universities, including Columbia University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_York\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2013-06-04T15:19:28","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_York","item_count":5703,"category":"Town","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":2,"woeid":23424948,"geohash":"w21zf8t5pf84","longitude":103.828,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1016","placetype":"Country","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1016\/","daily_count":2,"id":1016,"name":"Singapore","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/singapore\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/singapore\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/48\/Flag_of_Singapore.svg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:50:21.097646","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/QY","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1016","latitude":1.36558,"slug":"singapore","description":"<p><b>Singapore<\/b> (\/ˈsɪŋəpɔər\/ or \/ˈsɪŋɡəpɔər\/), officially the <b>Republic of Singapore<\/b>, is a sovereign city-state and island country in Southeast Asia. It lies off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula and is 137 kilometres (85 mi) north of the equator. The country's territory consists of the lozenge-shaped main island, commonly referred to as <i>Singapore Island<\/i> in English and Pulau Ujong in Malay, and more than 60 significantly smaller islets. Singapore is separated from Peninsular Malaysia by the Straits of Johor to the north, and from Indonesia's Riau Islands by the Singapore Strait to the south. The country is highly urbanised, and little of the original vegetation remains. The country's territory has consistently expanded through land reclamation.<\/p>\n<p>The islands were settled in the second century AD and subsequently belonged to a series of local empires. Modern Singapore was founded in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles as a trading post of the East India Company with permission from the Johor Sultanate. The British obtained sovereignty over the island in 1824, and Singapore became one of the British Straits Settlements in 1826. Occupied by the Japanese during World War II, Singapore declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1963 and united with other former British territories to form Malaysia, from which it was expelled two years later through a unanimous act of parliament. Since then, Singapore has developed rapidly, earning recognition as one of the Four Asian Tigers.<\/p>\n<p>Singapore is one of the world's major commercial hubs, with the fourth-biggest financial centre and one of the five busiest ports. Its globalised and diversified economy depends heavily on trade, especially manufacturing, which represented 26 percent of Singapore's GDP in 2005. In terms of purchasing power parity, Singapore has the third-highest per capita income in the world but one of the world's highest income inequalities. It places highly in international rankings with regard to education, healthcare, and economic competitiveness. Just over five million people live in Singapore, of which approximately two million are foreign-born. While Singapore is diverse, ethnic Asians predominate: 75 percent of the population is Chinese, with significant minorities of Malays, Indians, and Eurasians. There are four official languages, English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil, and the country promotes multiculturalism through a range of official policies.<\/p>\n<p>Singapore is a unitary multiparty parliamentary republic, with a Westminster system of unicameral parliamentary government. The People's Action Party has won every election since self-government began in 1959. The dominance of the PAP, coupled with a low level of press freedom and suppressed civil liberties and political rights, has led to Singapore being classified as a semi-authoritarian regime. One of the five founding members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Singapore is also the host of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Secretariat, and a member of the East Asia Summit, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the Commonwealth.

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:28:30","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism","item_count":1815,"category":"Subvertical","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":24,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","daily_count":176,"id":1,"name":"crime & courts","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:43:58.435643","active":true,"links":"","kind":"vertical","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","latitude":null,"slug":"crime-courts","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state.

With an estimated 652,405 residents as of 2013, Seattle is the largest city in the Pacific Northwest region of North America and the fastest-growing major city in the United States. The Seattle metropolitan area of around 3.6 million inhabitants is the 14th largest metropolitan area in the United States. The city is situated on a narrow isthmus between Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and Lake Washington, about 100 miles (160 km) south of the Canada–United States border. A major gateway for trade with Asia, Seattle is the 8th largest port in the United States and 9th largest in North America in terms of container handling.<\/p>\n<p>The Seattle area had previously been inhabited by Native Americans for at least 4,000 years before the first permanent European settlers. Arthur A. Denny and his group of travelers, subsequently known as the Denny Party, arrived at Alki Point on November 13, 1851. The settlement was moved to its current site and named \"Seattle\" in 1853, after Chief Si'ahl of the local Duwamish and Suquamish tribes.<\/p>\n<p>Logging was Seattle's first major industry, but by the late 19th century the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. By 1910, Seattle was one of the 25 largest cities in the country. However, the Great Depression severely damaged the city's economy. Growth returned during and after World War II, due partially to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The city developed as a technology center in the 1980s, with companies like Amazon.com, Microsoft and T-Mobile US based in the area. The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000. Since then, Seattle has become a hub for green industry and a model for sustainable development.<\/p>\n<p>Seattle has a noteworthy musical history. From 1918 to 1951, there were nearly two dozen jazz nightclubs along Jackson Street from the current Chinatown\/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene developed the early careers of Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Ernestine Anderson and others. Seattle is also the birthplace of rock musician Jimi Hendrix and the alternative rock style grunge.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seattle\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2012-12-04T22:13:53","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seattle","item_count":906,"category":"Town","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":2,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=868","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/868\/","daily_count":3,"id":868,"name":"Amazon","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/amazon\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/amazon\/","image_url":"","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:33:52.163841","active":true,"links":"","kind":"tag","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/OA","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=868","latitude":null,"slug":"amazon","description":"<p>The <b>Amazons<\/b> are a nation of female warriors in Greek myth.<\/p>\n<p><b>Amazon<\/b> or <b>Amazone<\/b> may also refer to:<\/p>","image_credit":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:40:04","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Amazon","item_count":304,"category":"Company","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":2,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1265","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1265\/","daily_count":3,"id":1265,"name":"bomb threats","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/bomb-threats\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/bomb-threats\/","image_url":"","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:33:52.163841","active":true,"links":"","kind":"tag","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/UZ","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1265","latitude":null,"slug":"bomb-threats","description":"<p>A <b>bomb threat<\/b> is generally defined as a threat, usually verbal or written, to detonate an explosive or incendiary device to cause property damage, death, or injuries, whether or not such a device actually exists.<\/p>\n<p>Criminal statutes typically dictate severe penalties. For example, the American state of Massachusetts provides for penalties of up to 20 years in prison, up to $50,000 fine, and restitution for the costs of the disruption. New York law makes it an \"E Felony ... to issue a false bomb threat directed toward a school in New York State.\"<\/p>\n<p>Some statutory definitions include the threatened use, release or placement of other harmful agents, such as poisons, biological pathogens, radioactive materials, or even a dangerous weapon (e.g., aboard an airliner). Other statutes enhance the penalties for threats made against specific places or persons (e.g., government facilities or dignitaries), and the actual possession of harmful devices or agents.<\/p>\n<p>Many bomb threats that are not pranks are made as parts of other crimes, such as extortion, aircraft hijacking, arson, robbery, or school attack. Actual bombings for malicious destruction of property, terrorism, or murder are often perpetrated without warnings.<\/p>\n<p>The decision to evacuate an area or building, depending on the perceived reliability of the threat, may be made by local controlling authorities or those in charge of the targeted facility based on advice from bomb disposal experts. When a large facility is involved, it can be very difficult and time-consuming to ensure the absence of any bomb or other hazardous device or substance.<\/p>\n<p>During the Northern Ireland conflict, paramilitary groups used pre-arranged code words when making bomb threats, to add authenticity to their claims of involvement.

Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","item_count":48293,"category":"Topic","livevideo":""}],"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/12\/15\/seattle-police-say-officers-complete-search-of-ama","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1vTflyz","url_domain":"seattle.gov","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/12\/15\/seattle-police-say-officers-complete-search-of-ama","author":{"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/8\/","last_name":"Clary","first_name":"Stephanie","email":"stephanie.clary@breakingnews.com","is_staff":true,"id":8,"full_name":"Stephanie Clary","username":"stephanie.clary"},"type":"text","whoas":11,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CBw2","push_content":"Seattle police say officers complete search of Amazon headquarters, no evidence of credible threat; say they continue to investigate case, work to identify person who left note - @SeattlePD","content":"Seattle police say officers complete search of Amazon headquarters, no evidence of credible threat; say they continue to investigate case, work to identify person who left note - @SeattlePD","slug":"seattle-police-say-officers-complete-search-of-ama","importance":3,"note":null,"media":null},{"tweet":{"tweet_id":"544635344596254720","resource_uri":"","location":"Washington, D.C.","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/markknoller\/status\/544635344596254720","id":278390,"user_id":"31127446","date":"2014-12-15T23:29:19","name":"Mark Knoller","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/137394623\/knoller_normal.jpg","content":"Pres Obama quick to issue statement hailing Senate confirmation of his Surgeon General nominee Dr. Vivek Murthy.","screen_name":"markknoller"},"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/markknoller\/status\/544635344596254720","date_ap":"Dec 15, 2014, 11:31 PM GMT","data":null,"submitter":"editor","date":"2014-12-15T23:31:20.418532","status":"published","source":null,"pushed":false,"updated_date":"2014-12-15T23:31:28.413928","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/483529\/","data_type":null,"id":483529,"topics":[{"recent_count":7,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"off","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=78","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/78\/","daily_count":8,"id":78,"name":"Obama 2nd term nominations","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/obama-cabinet-nominees\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/obama-cabinet-nominees\/","image_url":"","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:31:20.418532","active":true,"links":"","kind":"arc","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BQ","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=78","latitude":null,"slug":"obama-cabinet-nominees","description":"<p>Follow updates on the nominations for key positions during President Obama's second term in office.<\/p>\r\n\r\n","image_credit":"","created_on":"2013-01-17T00:50:07","wikipedia_url":"","item_count":357,"category":"PoliticsEvent","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":4,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=5","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/5\/","daily_count":9,"id":5,"name":"Barack Obama","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/barack-obama\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/barack-obama\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8d\/President_Barack_Obama.jpg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:31:20.418532","active":true,"links":"","kind":"tag","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/F","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=5","latitude":null,"slug":"barack-obama","description":"<p><b>Barack Hussein Obama II<\/b> (<small>US<\/small> \/bəˈrɑːk huːˈseɪn ɵˈbɑːmə\/, <small>UK<\/small> \/ˈbæræk huːˈseɪn ɵˈbɑːmə\/; born August 4, 1961) is the 44th and current President of the United States, and the first African American to hold the office. Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he served as president of the <i>Harvard Law Review<\/i>. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He served three terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, running unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 2000.<\/p>\n<p>In 2004, Obama received national attention during his campaign to represent Illinois in the United States Senate with his victory in the March Democratic Party primary, his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July, and his election to the Senate in November. He began his presidential campaign in 2007 and, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008, he won sufficient delegates in the Democratic Party primaries to receive the presidential nomination. He then defeated Republican nominee John McCain in the general election, and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2009. Nine months after his election, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.<\/p>\n<p>During his first two years in office, Obama signed into law economic stimulus legislation in response to the Great Recession in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Other major domestic initiatives in his first term included the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as \"Obamacare\"; the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. In foreign policy, Obama ended U.S. military involvement in the Iraq War, increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, signed the New START arms control treaty with Russia, ordered U.S. military involvement in Libya, and ordered the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. In November 2010, the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives as the Democratic Party lost a total of 63 seats; and, after a lengthy debate over federal spending and whether or not to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Obama was re-elected president in November 2012, defeating Republican nominee Mitt Romney, and was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. During his second term, Obama has promoted domestic policies related to gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and has called for full equality for LGBT Americans, while his administration has filed briefs which urged the Supreme Court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 and California's Proposition 8 as unconstitutional. In foreign policy, Obama ordered U.S. military involvement in Iraq in response to gains made by the Islamic State in Iraq after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, and has continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barack_Obama\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2010-05-07T23:31:02","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barack_Obama","item_count":8725,"category":"Person","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":6,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=74","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/74\/","daily_count":9,"id":74,"name":"United States Senate","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states-senate\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states-senate\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f0\/Seal_of_the_United_States_Senate.svg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:31:20.418532","active":true,"links":"","kind":"tag","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BM","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=74","latitude":null,"slug":"united-states-senate","description":"<p>The <b>United States Senate<\/b> is a legislative chamber in the bicameral legislature of the United States of America, and together with the U.S. House of Representatives makes up the U.S. Congress.

Instruction began in 1855; women were admitted in 1869. Today, the main campus is a 240-acre (97 ha) parcel in Evanston, along the shores of Lake Michigan. The university's law and medical schools are located on a 25-acre (10 ha) campus in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood. In 2008, the University opened a campus in Education City, Doha, Qatar with programs in journalism and communication. Today, Northwestern University ranks as one of the leading research institutions of the world especially in the chemical arts and it consistently outranks several of the Ivy League Schools. In academic year 2010-2011, Northwestern enrolled 8,397 undergraduate and 7,870 graduate and professional students.<\/p>\n<p>Northwestern has one of the largest university endowments in the United States, valued at $7.9 billion in 2013. One of only 62 institutions elected to the Association of American Universities (1917), Northwestern was awarded more than $500 million in research grants in 2010–2011, placing it in the first tier of the major research universities in the United States by the Center for Measuring University Performance. Its schools of journalism, management, engineering, and communication, for example, are among the most academically productive in the nation. Northwestern is a founding member of the Big Ten Conference and remains the only private university in the conference. The Northwestern Wildcats compete in 19 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA's Division I.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Northwestern_University\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2014-03-11T21:40:34.736453","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Northwestern_University","item_count":42,"category":"University","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":8,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":"breakingmoney","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=7","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/7\/","daily_count":31,"id":7,"name":"business","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/business\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/business\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/87\/Downtownplazala.jpg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:55:57.026965","active":true,"links":"","kind":"vertical","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/H","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=7","latitude":null,"slug":"business","description":"<p>A <b>business<\/b>, also known as an <b>enterprise<\/b> or a <b>firm<\/b>, is an organization involved in the trade of goods, services, or both to consumers.

Hundreds of sports exist, from those requiring only two participants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports, although limits the amount of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first, or by the determination of judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>In organised sport, records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. In addition, sport is a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T.

Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he served as president of the <i>Harvard Law Review<\/i>. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He served three terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, running unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 2000.<\/p>\n<p>In 2004, Obama received national attention during his campaign to represent Illinois in the United States Senate with his victory in the March Democratic Party primary, his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July, and his election to the Senate in November. He began his presidential campaign in 2007 and, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008, he won sufficient delegates in the Democratic Party primaries to receive the presidential nomination. He then defeated Republican nominee John McCain in the general election, and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2009. Nine months after his election, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.<\/p>\n<p>During his first two years in office, Obama signed into law economic stimulus legislation in response to the Great Recession in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Other major domestic initiatives in his first term included the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as \"Obamacare\"; the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. In foreign policy, Obama ended U.S. military involvement in the Iraq War, increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, signed the New START arms control treaty with Russia, ordered U.S. military involvement in Libya, and ordered the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. In November 2010, the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives as the Democratic Party lost a total of 63 seats; and, after a lengthy debate over federal spending and whether or not to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Obama was re-elected president in November 2012, defeating Republican nominee Mitt Romney, and was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. During his second term, Obama has promoted domestic policies related to gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and has called for full equality for LGBT Americans, while his administration has filed briefs which urged the Supreme Court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 and California's Proposition 8 as unconstitutional. In foreign policy, Obama ordered U.S. military involvement in Iraq in response to gains made by the Islamic State in Iraq after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, and has continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barack_Obama\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2010-05-07T23:31:02","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barack_Obama","item_count":8725,"category":"Person","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":2,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=46513","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/46513\/","daily_count":19,"id":46513,"name":"Editor items","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/editor-items\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/editor-items\/","image_url":"","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:25:12.872143","active":true,"links":"","kind":"tag","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/MGN","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=46513","latitude":null,"slug":"editor-items","description":"","image_credit":"","created_on":"2013-10-08T01:02:58.477256","wikipedia_url":"","item_count":1212,"category":"Special","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":1,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=152","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/152\/","daily_count":1,"id":152,"name":"elections","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/elections\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/elections\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/fc\/Election_MG_3455.JPG","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:25:12.872143","active":true,"links":"","kind":"tag","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cc","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=152","latitude":null,"slug":"elections","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades; the continent was explored and an additional five self-governing Crown Colonies were established.<\/p>\n<p>On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Since Federation, Australia has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy comprising six states and several territories. The population of 23.6 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated in the eastern states and on the coast.<\/p>\n<p>Australia is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the world's 12th-largest economy.

With the second-highest human development index globally, Australia ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, and the protection of civil liberties and political rights.

Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the south-west, and the Bay of Bengal on the south-east, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north-east; and Burma and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; in addition, India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.<\/p>\n<p>Home to the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires, the Indian subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history. Four world religions—Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism—originated here, whereas Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived in the 1st millennium CE and also helped shape the region's diverse culture. Gradually annexed by and brought under the administration of the British East India Company from the early 18th century and administered directly by the United Kingdom from the mid-19th century, India became an independent nation in 1947 after a struggle for independence that was marked by non-violent resistance led by Mahatma Gandhi.<\/p>\n<p>The Indian economy is the world's tenth-largest by nominal GDP and third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).

A nuclear weapons state and a regional power, it has the third-largest standing army in the world and ranks ninth in military expenditure among nations. India is a federal constitutional republic governed under a parliamentary system consisting of 29 states and 7 union territories. India is a pluralistic, multilingual, and a multi-ethnic society.

The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population.

The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","item_count":15126,"category":"Country","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":6,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=74","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/74\/","daily_count":9,"id":74,"name":"United States Senate","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states-senate\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states-senate\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f0\/Seal_of_the_United_States_Senate.svg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:31:20.418532","active":true,"links":"","kind":"tag","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BM","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=74","latitude":null,"slug":"united-states-senate","description":"<p>The <b>United States Senate<\/b> is a legislative chamber in the bicameral legislature of the United States of America, and together with the U.S. House of Representatives makes up the U.S. Congress.

ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","item_count":48293,"category":"Topic","livevideo":""}],"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/12\/15\/ayatollah-mohammad-hussein-al-ansari-australias","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1wbjxyU","url_domain":"theguardian.com","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/12\/15\/ayatollah-mohammad-hussein-al-ansari-australias","author":{"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","last_name":"Brew","first_name":"Tom","email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","is_staff":true,"id":7,"full_name":"Tom Brew","username":"tom.brew"},"type":"text","whoas":13,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CBwo","push_content":"Ayatollah Mohammad Hussein al-Ansari, Australia's most senior Shia cleric: 'This crisis reminds us that we all, from all faiths and backgrounds, should unite as Australians to oppose such radicalism and build a peaceful and harmonious society' - @guardian","content":"Ayatollah Mohammad Hussein al-Ansari, Australia's most senior Shia cleric: 'This crisis reminds us that we all, from all faiths and backgrounds, should unite as Australians to oppose such radicalism and build a peaceful and harmonious society' - @guardian","slug":"ayatollah-mohammad-hussein-al-ansari-australias","importance":2,"note":null,"media":null},{"tweet":null,"url":"http:\/\/local.nixle.com\/alert\/5319924\/","date_ap":"Dec 15, 2014, 11:08 PM GMT","data":null,"submitter":"editor","date":"2014-12-15T23:08:23.805914","status":"published","source":null,"pushed":true,"updated_date":"2014-12-15T23:08:28.836820","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/483514\/","data_type":null,"id":483514,"topics":[{"recent_count":1,"woeid":2463583,"geohash":"9q9p1d5w8t7j","longitude":-122.273,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=699","placetype":"Town","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/699\/","daily_count":7,"id":699,"name":"Oakland, CA, US","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/oakland-ca-us\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/oakland-ca-us\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d5\/OAKLAND%2C_CA%2C_USA_-_Skyline_and_Bridge.JPG","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:08:23.805914","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LR","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=699","latitude":37.8051,"slug":"oakland-ca-us","primary":true,"description":"<p><b>Oakland<\/b> \/ˈoʊklənd\/ is a major West Coast port city in the U.S. state of California. The Port of Oakland is the busiest port for San Francisco Bay and all of Northern California. Oakland is the third largest city in the San Francisco Bay Area, the eighth-largest city in the state, and the 47th-largest city in the U.S. with a population at the 2010 U.S. Census of 390,724. Incorporated in 1852, Oakland is the county seat of Alameda County. It serves as a major transportation hub and trade center for the entire region and is also the principal city of the Bay Area Region known as the East Bay. The city is situated directly across the bay, six miles (9.7 km) east of San Francisco.<\/p>\n<p>Oakland's territory covers what was once a mosaic of coastal terrace prairie, oak woodland, and north coastal scrub. Its land served as a rich resource when its hillside oak and redwood timber were logged to build San Francisco, and Oakland's fertile flatland soils helped it become a prolific agricultural region. In the late 1860s, Oakland was selected as the western terminal of the Transcontinental Railroad. It continued to grow in the 20th century with its busy port, shipyards, and a thriving automobile industry. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, many San Franciscans relocated to Oakland, enlarging the city's population, increasing its housing stock and improving its infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>A steady influx of immigrants during the 20th century, along with thousands of African-American war-industry workers who relocated from the Deep South during the 1940s, have made Oakland one of the most ethnically diverse major cities in the country. Oakland is known for its history of political activism, as well as its professional sports franchises and major corporations, which include health care, dot-com companies and manufacturers of household products. The city is a transportation hub for the greater Bay Area, and its shipping port is the fifth busiest in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Oakland has a Mediterranean climate with an average of 260 sunny days per year. Lake Merritt, a large estuary centrally located east of Downtown, was designated the United States' first official wildlife refuge. Jack London Square, named for the author and former resident, is a tourist destination on the Oakland waterfront.<\/p>\n<p>Much progress has been made in reducing the city's high crime rate; violent crime is primarily concentrated in certain neighborhoods, and property crime has declined throughout the city. Oakland is continually listed among the top cities in the United States for sustainability practices, including a No. 1 ranking for usage of electricity from renewable resources. Significant portions of Oakland suffer from severe lead contamination.<\/p>\n<p>In recent years, Oakland has gained national recognition as a travel destination. In 2012, Oakland was named the top North American city to visit, highlighting its growing number of sophisticated restaurants and bars, top music venues, and increasing nightlife appeal. Oakland also took the No. 16 spot in \"America's Coolest Cities,\" ranked by metrics like entertainment options and recreational opportunities per capita, etc. In 2013, Oakland topped the No. 1 spot in \"America's Most Exciting Cities,\" notably having the most movie theaters, theater companies, and museums per square mile. In \"America's Most Hipster Cities,\" Oakland took the No. 5 spot, cited for luring San Francisco \"hippies\" into the city.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oakland,_California\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2010-07-08T23:10:58","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oakland,_California","item_count":464,"category":"Town","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":1,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=73445","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/73445\/","daily_count":9,"id":73445,"name":"Eric Garner dies in NYC police custody, July 2014","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/man-dies-in-new-york-city-police-custody-july-2014\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/man-dies-in-new-york-city-police-custody-july-2014\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/cb\/TAG_Sharpton_Esaw_Garner.jpg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:08:23.805914","active":true,"links":"","kind":"arc","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/TGl","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=73445","latitude":null,"slug":"man-dies-in-new-york-city-police-custody-july-2014","description":"<p>On July 17, 2014, in Staten Island, New York, United States, Eric Garner died of a heart-attack after being placed in a choke-hold by an officer, a tactic banned by the Police Department. On this day, he was initially approached by police officer Justin Damico. A fellow officer, Daniel Pantaleo, put Garner on the ground by the use of force after Garner refused to be handcuffed and swatted at officers, Pantaleo using his arms around the much taller Garner's head, applying a headlock or chokehold shown in a widely viewed video recording of the event. Garner died some minutes later. NYPD Union leader Patrick Lynch challenged the claim that a chokehold was used.<\/p>\n<p>On August 1, 2014, city medical examiners concluded that Garner was killed by neck compression from the chokehold along with “the compression of his chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police”.

The hinterland of the metropolitan area is surrounded by national parks, and the coastal regions feature many bays, rivers, inlets and beaches, including the famous Bondi and Manly beaches. Within the city are many parklands, including Hyde Park and the Royal Botanic Gardens.<\/p>\n<p>Sydney has hosted multiple major international sporting events, including the 1938 British Empire Games (now known as the Commonwealth Games), the 2000 Summer Olympics and the final of the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300 miles per hour (483 km\/h), stretch more than two miles (3.2 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km).<\/p>\r\n<p>Various types of tornadoes include the landspout, multiple vortex tornado, and waterspout. Waterspouts are characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator, and are less common at high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirls, and steam devil; downbursts are frequently confused with tornadoes, though their action is dissimilar.<\/p>\r\n<p>Tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica. However, the vast majority of tornadoes occur in the Tornado Alley region of the United States, although they can occur nearly anywhere in North America. They also occasionally occur in south-central and eastern Asia, northern and east-central South America, Southern Africa, northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand. Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of Pulse-Doppler radar by recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data, such as hook echoes or debris balls, as well as through the efforts of storm spotters.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are several scales for rating the strength of tornadoes. The Fujita scale rates tornadoes by damage caused and has been replaced in some countries by the updated Enhanced Fujita Scale. An F0 or EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees, but not substantial structures. An F5 or EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and assign a rating.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tornado\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:18:36","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tornado","item_count":3872,"category":"Subvertical","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":1,"woeid":12588899,"geohash":"dj87ce7u3x5f","longitude":-89.5773,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=36255","placetype":"County","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/36255\/","daily_count":1,"id":36255,"name":"Covington, MS, US","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/covington-ms-us\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/covington-ms-us\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/08\/Covington_County_Courthouse.jpg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T22:42:42.702266","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Jav","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=36255","latitude":31.6153,"slug":"covington-ms-us","description":"<p><b>Covington County<\/b> is a county located in the U.S. state of Mississippi.

Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc. Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's <i>Great Red Spot<\/i>, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather","item_count":26167,"category":"Topic","livevideo":""}],"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/12\/15\/tornado-warning-issued-for-covington-simpson-and","shortened_url":"http:\/\/wxch.nl\/1uPGS4N","url_domain":"weather.com","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/12\/15\/tornado-warning-issued-for-covington-simpson-and","author":{"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","last_name":"Stampher","first_name":"Jillian","email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","is_staff":true,"id":14,"full_name":"Jillian Stampher","username":"jillian.stamper"},"type":"text","whoas":5,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CBwa","push_content":"Tornado warning issued for Covington, Simpson and Smith Counties in Mississippi until 5:45 pm CT - @TWCBreaking","content":"Tornado warning issued for Covington, Simpson and Smith Counties in Mississippi until 5:45 pm CT - @TWCBreaking","slug":"tornado-warning-issued-for-covington-simpson-and","importance":2,"note":null,"media":null},{"tweet":{"tweet_id":"544619955707072513","resource_uri":"","location":"Canberra","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kerrinbinnie\/status\/544619955707072513","id":278362,"user_id":"58310546","date":"2014-12-15T22:28:10","name":"Kerrin Binnie","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/484276090429399040\/5U3ilCVz_normal.jpeg","content":"Parliament House flag has been lowered to half mast #MartinPlace http:\/\/t.co\/0QPC0AAsmK","screen_name":"kerrinbinnie"},"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kerrinbinnie\/status\/544619955707072513\/photo\/1","date_ap":"Dec 15, 2014, 10:38 PM GMT","data":null,"submitter":"editor","date":"2014-12-15T22:38:42.870555","status":"published","source":null,"pushed":false,"updated_date":"2014-12-15T22:38:48.873777","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/483498\/","data_type":null,"id":483498,"topics":[{"recent_count":13,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=99651","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/99651\/","daily_count":121,"id":99651,"name":"Sydney hostage situation, December 2014","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/hostage-situation-in-martin-place-sydney-cafe-december-2014\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/hostage-situation-in-martin-place-sydney-cafe-december-2014\/","image_url":"","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:43:58.435643","active":true,"links":"","kind":"arc","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z5R","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=99651","latitude":null,"slug":"hostage-situation-in-martin-place-sydney-cafe-december-2014","description":"","image_credit":"","created_on":"2014-12-14T23:37:51.037468","wikipedia_url":"","item_count":125,"category":"CrimeCourtsEvent","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":7,"woeid":23424748,"geohash":"qgwf78ckqxyp","longitude":133.398,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1206","placetype":"Country","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1206\/","daily_count":33,"id":1206,"name":"Australia","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/australia\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/australia\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/e0\/Map_of_Australia.png","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:20:28.684912","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Tc","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1206","latitude":-24.9121,"slug":"australia","description":"<p><b>Australia<\/b> \/əˈstreɪljə, ɒ-, -iə\/, officially the <b>Commonwealth of Australia<\/b>, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.

After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades; the continent was explored and an additional five self-governing Crown Colonies were established.<\/p>\n<p>On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia.

With a population of 381,488, it is Australia's largest inland city and the eighth-largest city overall. The city is located at the northern end of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), 280 km (170 mi) south-west of Sydney, and 660 km (410 mi) north-east of Melbourne. A resident of Canberra is known as a \"Canberran\".<\/p>\n<p>The site of Canberra was selected for the location of the nation's capital in 1908 as a compromise between rivals Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two largest cities. It is unusual among Australian cities, being an entirely planned city outside of any state, similar to the American Federal District of Columbia. Following an international contest for the city's design, a blueprint by the Chicago architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913. The Griffins' plan featured geometric motifs such as circles, hexagons and triangles, and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks in the Australian Capital Territory.<\/p>\n<p>The city's design was influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation that have earned Canberra the title of the \"bush capital\". The growth and development of Canberra were hindered by the World Wars and the Great Depression, which exacerbated a series of planning disputes and the ineffectiveness of a procession of bodies that were created in turn to oversee the development of the city. The national capital emerged as a thriving city after World War II, as Prime Minister Robert Menzies championed its development and the National Capital Development Commission was formed with executive powers. Although the Australian Capital Territory is now self-governing, the federal government retains some influence through the National Capital Authority.<\/p>\n<p>As the seat of the government of Australia, Canberra is the site of Parliament House, the High Court and numerous government departments and agencies. It is also the location of many social and cultural institutions of national significance, such as the Australian War Memorial, Australian National University, Australian Institute of Sport, National Gallery, National Museum and the National Library. The Australian Army's officer corps are trained at the Royal Military College, Duntroon and the Australian Defence Force Academy is also located in the capital.<\/p>\n<p>The ACT, like Washington, D.C. in the United States, is independent of any state, to prevent any one state from gaining an advantage by hosting the seat of Federal power. Unlike Washington, however, the ACT has voting representation in the Federal Parliament, and has its own independent Legislative Assembly and government, similar to the states.<\/p>\n<p>As the city has a high proportion of public servants, the federal government contributes the largest percentage of Gross State Product and is the largest single employer in Canberra. As the seat of government, the unemployment rate is lower and the average income higher than the national average, while property prices are relatively high, in part due to comparatively restricted development regulations. Tertiary education levels are higher, while the population is younger.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Canberra\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2012-04-13T01:52:18","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Canberra","item_count":32,"category":"Town","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":6,"woeid":28693026,"geohash":"","longitude":151.21,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=99647","placetype":"POI","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/99647\/","daily_count":79,"id":99647,"name":"Martin Place, Sydney, New South Wales, AU","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/martin-place-sydney-new-south-wales-au\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/martin-place-sydney-new-south-wales-au\/","image_url":"","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:43:58.435643","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z5N","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=99647","latitude":-33.8677,"slug":"martin-place-sydney-new-south-wales-au","description":"","image_credit":"","created_on":"2014-12-14T23:13:23.678679","wikipedia_url":"","item_count":83,"category":"POI","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":11,"woeid":1105779,"geohash":"r3gx2f1x62zn","longitude":151.021,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1724","placetype":"Town","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1724\/","daily_count":115,"id":1724,"name":"Sydney, New South Wales, AU","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sydney-new-south-wales-au\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/sydney-new-south-wales-au\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/2f\/Australia_location_map.svg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:43:58.435643","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/by","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1724","latitude":-33.8563,"slug":"sydney-new-south-wales-au","description":"<p><b>Sydney<\/b> \/ˈsɪdni\/ is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime.

It is bordered on the northwest by Armenia, Azerbaijan; with Kazakhstan and Russia across the Caspian Sea; on the northeast by Turkmenistan; on the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; on the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and on the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of 1,648,195 km<sup>2<\/sup> (636,372 sq mi), it is the second-largest nation in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world; with 78.4 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th most populous nation. It is the only country that has both a Caspian Sea and Indian Ocean coastline. Iran has been of geostrategic importance because of its central location in Eurasia and Western Asia and the Strait of Hormuz.<\/p>\n<p>Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of the Proto-Elamite and Elamite kingdom in 3200–2800 BCE. The Iranian Medes unified the country into the first of many empires in 625 BCE, after which it became the dominant cultural and political power in the region. Iran reached the pinnacle of its power during the Achaemenid Empire (First Persian Empire) founded by Cyrus the Great in 550 BCE, which at its greatest extent comprised major portions of the ancient world, stretching from parts of the Balkans (Bulgaria-Pannonia) and Thrace-Macedonia in the west, to the Indus Valley in the east, making it the largest empire the world had yet seen. The empire collapsed in 330 BCE following the conquests of Alexander the Great. The area eventually regained influence under the Parthian Empire and rose to prominence once more after the establishment of the Sasanian dynasty (Neo-Persian empire) in 224 CE, under which Iran again became one of the leading powers in the world along with the Byzantine Empire for the next four centuries.<\/p>\n<p>Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism were largely replaced after Rashidun Muslims invaded Persia in 633 CE, and conquered it by 651 CE. Iran thereafter played a vital role in the subsequent Islamic Golden Age, producing numerous influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. The emergence in 1501 of the Safavid dynasty, which promoted the Twelver school of thought as the official religion, marked one of the most important turning points in Iranian and Muslim history. It also culminated into tensions, which in 1514 led to the Battle of Chaldiran. Starting in 1736 under Nader Shah, Iran would for the last time rise to high prominence, reaching its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid Empire, and briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire in the world. The Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1906 established the nation's first parliament, which operated within a constitutional monarchy. Following a coup d'état instigated by the UK and the US in 1953, Iran gradually became autocratic. Growing dissent against foreign influence and political repression culminated in the Iranian Revolution, which led to the establishment of an Islamic republic on 1 April 1979.<\/p>\n<p>Tehran is the capital and largest city, serving as the cultural, commercial, and industrial center of the nation. Iran is a major regional and middle power, exerting considerable influence in international energy security and the world economy through its large reserves of fossil fuels, which include the largest natural gas supply in the world and the fourth-largest proven petroleum reserves. It hosts Asia's fourth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Globally, it ranks 8th in the world for the amount of books published per year, and in 2011 was ranked first in the world in the growth of its scientific output.<\/p>\n<p>Iran is a founding member of the UN, NAM, OIC and OPEC. Its unique political system, based on the 1979 constitution, combines elements of a parliamentary democracy with a religious theocracy run by the country's clergy, wherein the Supreme Leader wields significant influence. A multicultural nation comprising numerous ethnic and linguistic groups, most inhabitants are Shi'ites, the Iranian rial is its currency, and Persian is the official language.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iran\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:27:32","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iran","item_count":2940,"category":"Country","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":11,"woeid":1105779,"geohash":"r3gx2f1x62zn","longitude":151.021,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1724","placetype":"Town","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1724\/","daily_count":115,"id":1724,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sydney-new-south-wales-au\/","name":"Sydney, New South Wales, AU","local_url":"\/topic\/sydney-new-south-wales-au\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/2f\/Australia_location_map.svg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:43:58.435643","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/by","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1724","latitude":-33.8563,"slug":"sydney-new-south-wales-au","description":"<p><b>Sydney<\/b> \/ˈsɪdni\/ is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania.

They are currently members of the North Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) of the National Football League (NFL). Their current home venue is FirstEnergy Stadium (called Cleveland Browns Stadium from its opening in 1999 to 2012). Their administrative offices and training facilities are located in Berea, Ohio. The Browns' official colors are burnt orange, seal brown, and white. They are unique among the 32 member franchises of the National Football League in that they do not have a helmet logo.<\/p>\n<p>The Cleveland Browns were founded in 1945 by businessman Arthur B. “Mickey” McBride as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), which began play the following year. The Cleveland Browns went on to dominate the AAFC, compiling a 47–4–3 record in the league's four active seasons and winning its championship in each of them. When the AAFC folded after the 1949 season, the Browns joined the National Football League (along with the San Francisco 49ers and the original Baltimore Colts). The Browns won a championship in their inaugural NFL season, as well as in the 1954, 1955, and 1964 seasons. From 1965 to 1995, they made the playoffs 14 times, but have never won another championship or even appeared in the Super Bowl.<\/p>\n<p>During the 1995 season, owner Art Modell, who had purchased the Browns in 1961, announced plans to move the team to Baltimore, Maryland. After threats of legal action from the city of Cleveland and fans, a compromise was reached in early 1996 that allowed Modell to establish the Baltimore Ravens as a new franchise while retaining the contracts of all Browns personnel. The Browns' intellectual property, including team name, logos, training facility, and history, were kept in trust and the franchise was regarded by the NFL as suspended. A new team would be established by 1999 either by expansion or relocation. The Browns were announced as an expansion team in 1998 and resumed play in 1999.<\/p>\n<p>Since resuming operations in 1999, the Cleveland Browns have posted a 77–163 record through the 2013 season. They have had two winning seasons: a 9–7 record in 2002 and a 10–6 record in 2007, and qualified for the playoffs in the former as a wild card team.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cleveland_Browns\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2012-04-26T23:22:31","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cleveland_Browns","item_count":67,"category":"SportsTeam","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":1,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=96639","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/96639\/","daily_count":10,"id":96639,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/12-year-old-boy-shot-killed-by-cleveland-police\/","name":"Tamir Rice killed by Cleveland police","local_url":"\/topic\/12-year-old-boy-shot-killed-by-cleveland-police\/","image_url":"","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:08:23.805914","active":true,"links":"","kind":"arc","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/ZIr","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=96639","latitude":null,"slug":"12-year-old-boy-shot-killed-by-cleveland-police","description":"Officials in Cleveland have been investigating the police shooting of a 12-year-old boy who died after an officer shot him outside a recreation center when he reached for a weapon that turned out to be a fake pistol. - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/11\/24\/us\/boy-12-dies-after-being-shot-by-cleveland-police-officer.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw&_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times<\/a>","image_credit":"","created_on":"2014-11-23T20:34:15.514616","wikipedia_url":"","item_count":33,"category":"CrimeCourtsEvent","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":0,"woeid":2381475,"geohash":"dpmuj5dwksz5","longitude":-81.6907,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=965","placetype":"Town","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/965\/","daily_count":1,"id":965,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/cleveland-oh-us\/","name":"Cleveland, OH, US","local_url":"\/topic\/cleveland-oh-us\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8d\/Montage_Cleveland_1.jpg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T01:39:01.649755","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Pj","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=965","latitude":41.5047,"slug":"cleveland-oh-us","description":"<p><b>Cleveland<\/b> \/ˈkliːvlənd\/ is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and is the county seat of Cuyahoga County, the most populous county in the state.

The offense attempts to advance an oval ball (the football) down the field by running with or passing it. They must advance it at least ten yards in four downs to receive a new set of four downs and continue the drive; if not, they turn over the football to the opposing team.

It is composed of 32 teams divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The highest professional level of the sport in the world, the NFL runs a 17-week regular season from the week after Labor Day to the week after Christmas, with each team playing sixteen games and having one bye week each season. Out of the league's 32 teams, six (four division winners and two wild-card teams) from each conference compete in the NFL playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, played between the champions of the NFC and AFC. The champions of the Super Bowl are awarded the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Various other awards exist to recognize individual players and coaches. Most games are played on Sunday afternoons; some games are also played on Mondays and Thursdays during the regular season. There are games on Saturdays during the first two playoff weekends. Sometimes, there are also Saturday games during the last few weeks of the regular season.<\/p>\n<p>The NFL was formed on August 20, 1920, as the <b>American Professional Football Conference<\/b>; the league changed its name to the <b>American Professional Football Association<\/b> (<b>APFA<\/b>) on September 17, 1920, and changed its name to the National Football League on June 24, 1922, after spending the 1920 and 1921 seasons as the APFA. In 1966, the NFL agreed to merge with the rival American Football League (AFL), effective 1970; the first Super Bowl was held at the end of that same season in January 1967. Today, the NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States. The Super Bowl is among the biggest club sporting events in the world and individual Super Bowl games account for many of the most-watched television programs in American history. At the corporate level, the NFL is a nonprofit 501(c)(6) association. The NFL's executive officer is the commissioner, who has broad authority in governing the league.<\/p>\n<p>Each team is allowed to have up to 53 players during the regular season, but only 46 can be active (eligible to play) on game days. Teams are given exclusive rights to sign free agents that have three or fewer seasons in the league, but free agents that have been in the league at least four years can sign with any team of their choosing. Each team is subject to a salary cap. The champions of the most recent season, the 2013 season, are the Seattle Seahawks, who defeated the Denver Broncos by a score of 43-8 in Super Bowl XLVIII. The team with the most championships is the Green Bay Packers, who have won 13 championships.

The population of 23.6 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated in the eastern states and on the coast.<\/p>\n<p>Australia is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the world's 12th-largest economy. In 2012 Australia had the world's fifth-highest per capita income, Australia's military expenditure is the world's 13th-largest. With the second-highest human development index globally, Australia ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, and the protection of civil liberties and political rights. Australia is a member of the United Nations, G20, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the Pacific Islands Forum.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Australia\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2011-05-16T23:32:05","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Australia","item_count":1968,"category":"Country","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":6,"woeid":28693026,"geohash":"","longitude":151.21,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=99647","placetype":"POI","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/99647\/","daily_count":79,"id":99647,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/martin-place-sydney-new-south-wales-au\/","name":"Martin Place, Sydney, New South Wales, AU","local_url":"\/topic\/martin-place-sydney-new-south-wales-au\/","image_url":"","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:43:58.435643","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z5N","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=99647","latitude":-33.8677,"slug":"martin-place-sydney-new-south-wales-au","description":"","image_credit":"","created_on":"2014-12-14T23:13:23.678679","wikipedia_url":"","item_count":83,"category":"POI","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":2,"woeid":2344700,"geohash":"r60v0r63td00","longitude":147.008,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=353","placetype":"State","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/353\/","daily_count":30,"id":353,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/new-south-wales-au\/","name":"New South Wales, AU","local_url":"\/topic\/new-south-wales-au\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/00\/Flag_of_New_South_Wales.svg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:40:52.198050","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Fr","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=353","latitude":-32.1658,"slug":"new-south-wales-au","description":"<p><b>New South Wales<\/b> (abbreviated as <b>NSW<\/b>) is a state on the east coast of Australia.

It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants. Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it <i>Londinium<\/i>. London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km<sup>2<\/sup>) mediaeval boundaries and in 2011 had a resident population of 7,375, making it the smallest city in England. Since at least the 19th century, the term <i>London<\/i> has also referred to the metropolis developed around this core. The bulk of this conurbation forms the Greater London administrative area (coterminous with the London region), governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.<\/p>\n<p>London is a leading global city, with strengths in the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism and transport all contributing to its prominence. It is one of the world's leading financial centres and has the fifth-or sixth-largest metropolitan area GDP in the world depending on measurement. London is a world cultural capital. It is the world's most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the world's largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic. London's 43 universities form the largest concentration of higher education in Europe. In 2012, London became the first city to host the modern Summer Olympic Games three times.<\/p>\n<p>London has a diverse range of peoples and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken within Greater London. The region had an official population of 8,416,535 in 2013, making it the most populous municipality in the European Union, and accounting for 12.5% of the UK population. London's urban area is the second-largest in the EU with a population of 9,787,426 according to the 2011 census. London's metropolitan area is the largest in the EU with a total population of 13,614,409, while the Greater London Authority puts the population of London metropolitan region at 21 million. London was the world's most populous city from around 1831 to 1925.<\/p>\n<p>London contains four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the site comprising the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and the historic settlement of Greenwich (in which the Royal Observatory, Greenwich marks the Prime Meridian, 0° longitude, and GMT). Other famous landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Trafalgar Square, and The Shard. London is home to numerous museums, galleries, libraries, sporting events and other cultural institutions, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Tate Modern, British Library and 40 West End theatres.

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:28:30","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism","item_count":1815,"category":"Subvertical","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":24,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","daily_count":176,"id":1,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","name":"crime & courts","local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:43:58.435643","active":true,"links":"","kind":"vertical","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","latitude":null,"slug":"crime-courts","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state.

It is a founding member of the European Union and hosts the EU's headquarters as well as those of several other major international organisations such as NATO. Belgium covers an area of 30,528 square kilometres (11,787 sq mi) and has a population of about 11 million people.<\/p>\n<p>Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population and Brussels inhabitants, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who are officially recognized.<\/p>\n<p>Belgium's two largest regions are the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders in the north and the French-speaking southern region of Wallonia. The Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual, is a mostly French-speaking enclave within the Flemish Region. A German-speaking Community exists in eastern Wallonia. Belgium's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of government.<\/p>\n<p>Historically, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg were known as the Low Countries; it once covered a somewhat larger area than the current Benelux group of states. The region was called Belgica in Latin, after the Roman province of Gallia Belgica, which covered more or less the same area. From the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th century, the area of Belgium was a prosperous and cosmopolitan centre of commerce and culture. From the 16th century until the Belgian Revolution in 1830, when Belgium seceded from the Netherlands, the area of Belgium served as the battleground between many European powers, causing it to be dubbed the \"Battlefield of Europe,\" a reputation strengthened by both World Wars.<\/p>\n<p>Upon its independence, Belgium participated in the Industrial Revolution and, during the course of the 20th century, possessed a number of colonies in Africa. The second half of the 20th century was marked by rising tensions between the Dutch-speaking and the French-speaking citizens fueled by differences in language and the unequal economic development of Flanders and Wallonia. This continuing antagonism has led to several far-reaching reforms, resulting in a transition from a unitary to a federal arrangement during the period from 1970 to 1993. Despite the reforms, tensions between the groups remain; the formation of a coalition government took 18 months following the June 2010 federal election.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Belgium\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2010-05-27T17:21:52","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Belgium","item_count":223,"category":"Country","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":0,"woeid":970013,"geohash":"u14dky7h3txv","longitude":3.72856,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=12589","placetype":"Town","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/12589\/","daily_count":5,"id":12589,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/ghent-oost-vlaanderen-be\/","name":"Ghent, Oost-Vlaanderen, BE","local_url":"\/topic\/ghent-oost-vlaanderen-be\/","image_url":"","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T10:43:53.732483","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/DRD","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=12589","latitude":51.0556,"slug":"ghent-oost-vlaanderen-be","description":"","image_credit":"","created_on":"2013-05-04T08:38:17","wikipedia_url":"","item_count":9,"category":"Town","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":24,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","daily_count":176,"id":1,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","name":"crime & courts","local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:43:58.435643","active":true,"links":"","kind":"vertical","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","latitude":null,"slug":"crime-courts","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state.

After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades; the continent was explored and an additional five self-governing Crown Colonies were established.<\/p>\n<p>On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Since Federation, Australia has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy comprising six states and several territories. The population of 23.6 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated in the eastern states and on the coast.<\/p>\n<p>Australia is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the world's 12th-largest economy. In 2012 Australia had the world's fifth-highest per capita income, Australia's military expenditure is the world's 13th-largest. With the second-highest human development index globally, Australia ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, and the protection of civil liberties and political rights. Australia is a member of the United Nations, G20, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the Pacific Islands Forum.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Australia\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2011-05-16T23:32:05","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Australia","item_count":1968,"category":"Country","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":6,"woeid":28693026,"geohash":"","longitude":151.21,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=99647","placetype":"POI","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/99647\/","daily_count":79,"id":99647,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/martin-place-sydney-new-south-wales-au\/","name":"Martin Place, Sydney, New South Wales, AU","local_url":"\/topic\/martin-place-sydney-new-south-wales-au\/","image_url":"","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:43:58.435643","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z5N","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=99647","latitude":-33.8677,"slug":"martin-place-sydney-new-south-wales-au","description":"","image_credit":"","created_on":"2014-12-14T23:13:23.678679","wikipedia_url":"","item_count":83,"category":"POI","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":2,"woeid":2344700,"geohash":"r60v0r63td00","longitude":147.008,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=353","placetype":"State","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/353\/","daily_count":30,"id":353,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/new-south-wales-au\/","name":"New South Wales, AU","local_url":"\/topic\/new-south-wales-au\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/00\/Flag_of_New_South_Wales.svg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:40:52.198050","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Fr","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=353","latitude":-32.1658,"slug":"new-south-wales-au","description":"<p><b>New South Wales<\/b> (abbreviated as <b>NSW<\/b>) is a state on the east coast of Australia.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.

One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial.

Inhabitants of Sydney are called <i>Sydneysiders<\/i>, comprising a cosmopolitan and international population. Sydney has been referred to as the most multicultural city in Australia and one of the most multicultural cities in the world.<\/p>\n<p>The site of the first British colony in Australia, Sydney was established in 1788 at Sydney Cove by Captain Arthur Phillip, of the First Fleet, as a penal colony. The city is built on hills surrounding one of the world's largest natural harbours, Port Jackson, which is commonly known as Sydney Harbour, where the iconic Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge are prominent structures. The hinterland of the metropolitan area is surrounded by national parks, and the coastal regions feature many bays, rivers, inlets and beaches, including the famous Bondi and Manly beaches. Within the city are many parklands, including Hyde Park and the Royal Botanic Gardens.<\/p>\n<p>Sydney has hosted multiple major international sporting events, including the 1938 British Empire Games (now known as the Commonwealth Games), the 2000 Summer Olympics and the final of the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

It is a founding member of the European Union and hosts the EU's headquarters as well as those of several other major international organisations such as NATO. Belgium covers an area of 30,528 square kilometres (11,787 sq mi) and has a population of about 11 million people.<\/p>\n<p>Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population and Brussels inhabitants, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who are officially recognized.<\/p>\n<p>Belgium's two largest regions are the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders in the north and the French-speaking southern region of Wallonia. The Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual, is a mostly French-speaking enclave within the Flemish Region. A German-speaking Community exists in eastern Wallonia. Belgium's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of government.<\/p>\n<p>Historically, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg were known as the Low Countries; it once covered a somewhat larger area than the current Benelux group of states. The region was called Belgica in Latin, after the Roman province of Gallia Belgica, which covered more or less the same area. From the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th century, the area of Belgium was a prosperous and cosmopolitan centre of commerce and culture. From the 16th century until the Belgian Revolution in 1830, when Belgium seceded from the Netherlands, the area of Belgium served as the battleground between many European powers, causing it to be dubbed the \"Battlefield of Europe,\" a reputation strengthened by both World Wars.<\/p>\n<p>Upon its independence, Belgium participated in the Industrial Revolution and, during the course of the 20th century, possessed a number of colonies in Africa. The second half of the 20th century was marked by rising tensions between the Dutch-speaking and the French-speaking citizens fueled by differences in language and the unequal economic development of Flanders and Wallonia. This continuing antagonism has led to several far-reaching reforms, resulting in a transition from a unitary to a federal arrangement during the period from 1970 to 1993. Despite the reforms, tensions between the groups remain; the formation of a coalition government took 18 months following the June 2010 federal election.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Belgium\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2010-05-27T17:21:52","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Belgium","item_count":223,"category":"Country","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":0,"woeid":970013,"geohash":"u14dky7h3txv","longitude":3.72856,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=12589","placetype":"Town","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/12589\/","daily_count":5,"id":12589,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/ghent-oost-vlaanderen-be\/","name":"Ghent, Oost-Vlaanderen, BE","local_url":"\/topic\/ghent-oost-vlaanderen-be\/","image_url":"","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T10:43:53.732483","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/DRD","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=12589","latitude":51.0556,"slug":"ghent-oost-vlaanderen-be","description":"","image_credit":"","created_on":"2013-05-04T08:38:17","wikipedia_url":"","item_count":9,"category":"Town","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":24,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","daily_count":176,"id":1,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","name":"crime & courts","local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:43:58.435643","active":true,"links":"","kind":"vertical","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","latitude":null,"slug":"crime-courts","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state.

Neighbouring countries include Indonesia, East Timor and Papua New Guinea to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east.<\/p>\n<p>For at least 40,000 years before the first British settlement in the late 18th century, Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians, who spoke languages grouped into roughly 250 language groups. After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades; the continent was explored and an additional five self-governing Crown Colonies were established.<\/p>\n<p>On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Since Federation, Australia has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy comprising six states and several territories. The population of 23.6 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated in the eastern states and on the coast.<\/p>\n<p>Australia is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the world's 12th-largest economy. In 2012 Australia had the world's fifth-highest per capita income, Australia's military expenditure is the world's 13th-largest. With the second-highest human development index globally, Australia ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, and the protection of civil liberties and political rights. Australia is a member of the United Nations, G20, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the Pacific Islands Forum.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Australia\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2011-05-16T23:32:05","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Australia","item_count":1968,"category":"Country","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":6,"woeid":28693026,"geohash":"","longitude":151.21,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=99647","placetype":"POI","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/99647\/","daily_count":79,"id":99647,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/martin-place-sydney-new-south-wales-au\/","name":"Martin Place, Sydney, New South Wales, AU","local_url":"\/topic\/martin-place-sydney-new-south-wales-au\/","image_url":"","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:43:58.435643","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z5N","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=99647","latitude":-33.8677,"slug":"martin-place-sydney-new-south-wales-au","description":"","image_credit":"","created_on":"2014-12-14T23:13:23.678679","wikipedia_url":"","item_count":83,"category":"POI","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":11,"woeid":1105779,"geohash":"r3gx2f1x62zn","longitude":151.021,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1724","placetype":"Town","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1724\/","daily_count":115,"id":1724,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sydney-new-south-wales-au\/","name":"Sydney, New South Wales, AU","local_url":"\/topic\/sydney-new-south-wales-au\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/2f\/Australia_location_map.svg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:43:58.435643","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/by","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1724","latitude":-33.8563,"slug":"sydney-new-south-wales-au","description":"<p><b>Sydney<\/b> \/ˈsɪdni\/ is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania.

Sydney has been referred to as the most multicultural city in Australia and one of the most multicultural cities in the world.<\/p>\n<p>The site of the first British colony in Australia, Sydney was established in 1788 at Sydney Cove by Captain Arthur Phillip, of the First Fleet, as a penal colony. The city is built on hills surrounding one of the world's largest natural harbours, Port Jackson, which is commonly known as Sydney Harbour, where the iconic Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge are prominent structures. The hinterland of the metropolitan area is surrounded by national parks, and the coastal regions feature many bays, rivers, inlets and beaches, including the famous Bondi and Manly beaches. Within the city are many parklands, including Hyde Park and the Royal Botanic Gardens.<\/p>\n<p>Sydney has hosted multiple major international sporting events, including the 1938 British Empire Games (now known as the Commonwealth Games), the 2000 Summer Olympics and the final of the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

They are often referred to as <b>twisters<\/b> or <b>cyclones<\/b>, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology, in a wider sense, to name any closed low pressure circulation. Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, but they are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (177 km\/h), are about 250 feet (76 m) across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300 miles per hour (483 km\/h), stretch more than two miles (3.2 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km).<\/p>\r\n<p>Various types of tornadoes include the landspout, multiple vortex tornado, and waterspout. Waterspouts are characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator, and are less common at high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirls, and steam devil; downbursts are frequently confused with tornadoes, though their action is dissimilar.<\/p>\r\n<p>Tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica. However, the vast majority of tornadoes occur in the Tornado Alley region of the United States, although they can occur nearly anywhere in North America. They also occasionally occur in south-central and eastern Asia, northern and east-central South America, Southern Africa, northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand. Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of Pulse-Doppler radar by recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data, such as hook echoes or debris balls, as well as through the efforts of storm spotters.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are several scales for rating the strength of tornadoes. The Fujita scale rates tornadoes by damage caused and has been replaced in some countries by the updated Enhanced Fujita Scale. An F0 or EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees, but not substantial structures. An F5 or EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and assign a rating.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tornado\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:18:36","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tornado","item_count":3872,"category":"Subvertical","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":1,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":"breakingstorm","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=121","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/121\/","daily_count":4,"id":121,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/weather\/","name":"weather","local_url":"\/topic\/weather\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/fc\/Thunder_lightning_Garajau_Madeira_289985700.jpg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T22:42:42.702266","active":true,"links":"","kind":"vertical","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B7","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=121","latitude":null,"slug":"weather","description":"<p><b>Weather<\/b> is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc. Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's <i>Great Red Spot<\/i>, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather","item_count":26167,"category":"Topic","livevideo":""}],"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/12\/15\/photo-possible-tornado-seen-north-of-harper-kan","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1Axz4bd","url_domain":"twitter.com","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/12\/15\/photo-possible-tornado-seen-north-of-harper-kan","author":{"is_staff":true,"last_name":"Stampher","first_name":"Jillian","email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","id":14,"full_name":"Jillian Stampher","username":"jillian.stamper"},"type":"text","whoas":36,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CBko","push_content":"Photo: Possible tornado seen north of Harper, Kan., amid severe storm - via @KWCH12","content":"Photo: Possible tornado seen north of Harper, Kan., amid severe storm - via @KWCH12","slug":"photo-possible-tornado-seen-north-of-harper-kan","importance":1,"note":null,"media":{"provider_name":"Twitter","thumbnail_width":150,"thumbnail_height":150,"title":"Picture: #Tornado: MT @KWCH12: Storm shot 5 miles north of Harper #KS.

Montgomery County is very diverse, ranging from farms and open land in Upper Hanover to densely populated rowhouse streets in Cheltenham. Montgomery County is included in the <i>Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan Statistical Area<\/i>, as well as the much larger <i>Philadelphia-Reading-Camden, PA-NJ-DE-MD Combined Statistical Area<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>The county was created on September 10, 1784, out of land originally part of Philadelphia County. The first courthouse was housed in the Barley Sheaf Inn. It is believed to have been named either for Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 while attempting to capture Quebec City, Canada, or for the Welsh county of Montgomeryshire (which was named after one of William the Conqueror's main counselors, Roger de Montgomerie), as it was part of the Welsh Tract, an area of Pennsylvania settled by Quakers from Wales.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.

One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world.

Inhabitants of Sydney are called <i>Sydneysiders<\/i>, comprising a cosmopolitan and international population. Sydney has been referred to as the most multicultural city in Australia and one of the most multicultural cities in the world.<\/p>\n<p>The site of the first British colony in Australia, Sydney was established in 1788 at Sydney Cove by Captain Arthur Phillip, of the First Fleet, as a penal colony. The city is built on hills surrounding one of the world's largest natural harbours, Port Jackson, which is commonly known as Sydney Harbour, where the iconic Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge are prominent structures. The hinterland of the metropolitan area is surrounded by national parks, and the coastal regions feature many bays, rivers, inlets and beaches, including the famous Bondi and Manly beaches. Within the city are many parklands, including Hyde Park and the Royal Botanic Gardens.<\/p>\n<p>Sydney has hosted multiple major international sporting events, including the 1938 British Empire Games (now known as the Commonwealth Games), the 2000 Summer Olympics and the final of the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

As of the 2010 census, the population was 799,874, making it the third most populous county in Pennsylvania, after Philadelphia and Allegheny counties. The county seat is Norristown. Montgomery County is very diverse, ranging from farms and open land in Upper Hanover to densely populated rowhouse streets in Cheltenham. Montgomery County is included in the <i>Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan Statistical Area<\/i>, as well as the much larger <i>Philadelphia-Reading-Camden, PA-NJ-DE-MD Combined Statistical Area<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>The county was created on September 10, 1784, out of land originally part of Philadelphia County. The first courthouse was housed in the Barley Sheaf Inn. It is believed to have been named either for Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 while attempting to capture Quebec City, Canada, or for the Welsh county of Montgomeryshire (which was named after one of William the Conqueror's main counselors, Roger de Montgomerie), as it was part of the Welsh Tract, an area of Pennsylvania settled by Quakers from Wales. Early histories of the county indicate the origin of the county's name as uncertain.<\/p>\n<p>Montgomery County is a suburban county northwest of Philadelphia. It is part of the Delaware Valley and marks the region's northern border, with the Lehigh Valley region of the state to the north. In 2010 it was the 51st wealthiest county in the country (measured by median household income). In 2008 it was named the 9th Best Place to Raise a Family by Forbes.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Montgomery_County,_Pennsylvania\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2012-07-30T19:47:22","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Montgomery_County,_Pennsylvania","item_count":30,"category":"County","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":0,"woeid":2470314,"geohash":"","longitude":-75.4968,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=99724","placetype":"Town","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/99724\/","daily_count":5,"id":99724,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/pennsburg-pa-us\/","name":"Pennsburg, PA, US","local_url":"\/topic\/pennsburg-pa-us\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d8\/Map_of_Pennsburg%2C_Montgomery_County%2C_Pennsylvania_Highlighted.gif","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T20:33:58.919517","active":true,"links":"","kind":"location","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z6c","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=99724","latitude":40.3937,"slug":"pennsburg-pa-us","description":"<p><b>Pennsburg<\/b> is a borough in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States.

Inhabitants of Sydney are called <i>Sydneysiders<\/i>, comprising a cosmopolitan and international population. Sydney has been referred to as the most multicultural city in Australia and one of the most multicultural cities in the world.<\/p>\n<p>The site of the first British colony in Australia, Sydney was established in 1788 at Sydney Cove by Captain Arthur Phillip, of the First Fleet, as a penal colony. The city is built on hills surrounding one of the world's largest natural harbours, Port Jackson, which is commonly known as Sydney Harbour, where the iconic Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge are prominent structures. The hinterland of the metropolitan area is surrounded by national parks, and the coastal regions feature many bays, rivers, inlets and beaches, including the famous Bondi and Manly beaches. Within the city are many parklands, including Hyde Park and the Royal Botanic Gardens.<\/p>\n<p>Sydney has hosted multiple major international sporting events, including the 1938 British Empire Games (now known as the Commonwealth Games), the 2000 Summer Olympics and the final of the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

The Port of Oakland is the busiest port for San Francisco Bay and all of Northern California. Oakland is the third largest city in the San Francisco Bay Area, the eighth-largest city in the state, and the 47th-largest city in the U.S. with a population at the 2010 U.S. Census of 390,724. Incorporated in 1852, Oakland is the county seat of Alameda County. It serves as a major transportation hub and trade center for the entire region and is also the principal city of the Bay Area Region known as the East Bay. The city is situated directly across the bay, six miles (9.7 km) east of San Francisco.<\/p>\n<p>Oakland's territory covers what was once a mosaic of coastal terrace prairie, oak woodland, and north coastal scrub. Its land served as a rich resource when its hillside oak and redwood timber were logged to build San Francisco, and Oakland's fertile flatland soils helped it become a prolific agricultural region. In the late 1860s, Oakland was selected as the western terminal of the Transcontinental Railroad. It continued to grow in the 20th century with its busy port, shipyards, and a thriving automobile industry. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, many San Franciscans relocated to Oakland, enlarging the city's population, increasing its housing stock and improving its infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>A steady influx of immigrants during the 20th century, along with thousands of African-American war-industry workers who relocated from the Deep South during the 1940s, have made Oakland one of the most ethnically diverse major cities in the country. Oakland is known for its history of political activism, as well as its professional sports franchises and major corporations, which include health care, dot-com companies and manufacturers of household products. The city is a transportation hub for the greater Bay Area, and its shipping port is the fifth busiest in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Oakland has a Mediterranean climate with an average of 260 sunny days per year. Lake Merritt, a large estuary centrally located east of Downtown, was designated the United States' first official wildlife refuge. Jack London Square, named for the author and former resident, is a tourist destination on the Oakland waterfront.<\/p>\n<p>Much progress has been made in reducing the city's high crime rate; violent crime is primarily concentrated in certain neighborhoods, and property crime has declined throughout the city. Oakland is continually listed among the top cities in the United States for sustainability practices, including a No. 1 ranking for usage of electricity from renewable resources. Significant portions of Oakland suffer from severe lead contamination.<\/p>\n<p>In recent years, Oakland has gained national recognition as a travel destination. In 2012, Oakland was named the top North American city to visit, highlighting its growing number of sophisticated restaurants and bars, top music venues, and increasing nightlife appeal. Oakland also took the No. 16 spot in \"America's Coolest Cities,\" ranked by metrics like entertainment options and recreational opportunities per capita, etc. In 2013, Oakland topped the No. 1 spot in \"America's Most Exciting Cities,\" notably having the most movie theaters, theater companies, and museums per square mile. In \"America's Most Hipster Cities,\" Oakland took the No. 5 spot, cited for luring San Francisco \"hippies\" into the city.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oakland,_California\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2010-07-08T23:10:58","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oakland,_California","item_count":464,"category":"Town","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":1,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=73445","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/73445\/","daily_count":9,"id":73445,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/man-dies-in-new-york-city-police-custody-july-2014\/","name":"Eric Garner dies in NYC police custody, July 2014","local_url":"\/topic\/man-dies-in-new-york-city-police-custody-july-2014\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/cb\/TAG_Sharpton_Esaw_Garner.jpg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:08:23.805914","active":true,"links":"","kind":"arc","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/TGl","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=73445","latitude":null,"slug":"man-dies-in-new-york-city-police-custody-july-2014","description":"<p>On July 17, 2014, in Staten Island, New York, United States, Eric Garner died of a heart-attack after being placed in a choke-hold by an officer, a tactic banned by the Police Department. On this day, he was initially approached by police officer Justin Damico. A fellow officer, Daniel Pantaleo, put Garner on the ground by the use of force after Garner refused to be handcuffed and swatted at officers, Pantaleo using his arms around the much taller Garner's head, applying a headlock or chokehold shown in a widely viewed video recording of the event. Garner died some minutes later. NYPD Union leader Patrick Lynch challenged the claim that a chokehold was used.<\/p>\n<p>On August 1, 2014, city medical examiners concluded that Garner was killed by neck compression from the chokehold along with “the compression of his chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police”. Asthma, heart disease and obesity were contributing factors. As a result of Garner's death, four EMTs and paramedics who responded to Garner's death were suspended without pay on July 21, 2014, and officers Justin Damico and Daniel Pantaleo were placed on desk duty, the latter stripped of his service gun and badge.<\/p>\n<p>The event stirred public protests and rallies with charges of police brutality and was broadcast nationally over various media networks.<\/p>\n<p>On December 3, 2014, a grand jury decided not to indict Daniel Pantaleo, the officer involved in Garner's death.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Death_of_Eric_Garner\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2014-07-23T14:19:06.394895","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Death_of_Eric_Garner","item_count":340,"category":"CrimeCourtsEvent","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":1,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=96639","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/96639\/","daily_count":10,"id":96639,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/12-year-old-boy-shot-killed-by-cleveland-police\/","name":"Tamir Rice killed by Cleveland police","local_url":"\/topic\/12-year-old-boy-shot-killed-by-cleveland-police\/","image_url":"","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:08:23.805914","active":true,"links":"","kind":"arc","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/ZIr","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=96639","latitude":null,"slug":"12-year-old-boy-shot-killed-by-cleveland-police","description":"Officials in Cleveland have been investigating the police shooting of a 12-year-old boy who died after an officer shot him outside a recreation center when he reached for a weapon that turned out to be a fake pistol. - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/11\/24\/us\/boy-12-dies-after-being-shot-by-cleveland-police-officer.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw&_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times<\/a>","image_credit":"","created_on":"2014-11-23T20:34:15.514616","wikipedia_url":"","item_count":33,"category":"CrimeCourtsEvent","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=4743","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/4743\/","daily_count":3,"id":4743,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/michael-brown\/","name":"Michael Brown","local_url":"\/topic\/michael-brown\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/fc\/St._Louis_County_Missouri_Incorporated_and_Unincorporated_areas_Ferguson_Highlighted.svg","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T18:40:20.523413","active":true,"links":"","kind":"tag","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BOf","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=4743","latitude":null,"slug":"michael-brown","description":"<p>The <b>shooting of Michael Brown<\/b> occurred on August 9, 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Brown, an 18-year-old black man, was fatally shot by Darren Wilson, 28, a white Ferguson police officer. The disputed circumstances of the shooting and the resultant protests and civil unrest received considerable attention in the U.S. and abroad, and have sparked debate about law enforcement's relationship with African Americans and police use of force doctrine.<\/p>\n<p>Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson were walking down the middle of a street when Wilson drove up and told them to move to the sidewalk. An altercation ensued with Brown and Wilson struggling through the window of the police vehicle until Wilson's gun was fired. Brown and Johnson then fled in different directions, with Wilson in pursuit of Brown, eventually firing several more times. In the entire altercation, Wilson fired a total of twelve rounds; Brown was hit by seven or eight and the last was probably the fatal shot. Witness reports differed as to whether and when Brown had his hands raised, and whether he was moving toward Wilson when the final shots were fired.<\/p>\n<p>The shooting sparked unrest in Ferguson, in part due to the belief among many that Brown was surrendering, as well as longstanding racial tensions between the majority-black population and the majority-white city government and police. Protests, both peaceful and violent, along with vandalism and looting, continued for more than a week, resulting in night curfews. The response of area police agencies in dealing with the protests received significant criticism from the media and politicians. There were concerns over insensitivity, tactics and a militarized response. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon ordered local police organizations to cede much of their authority to the Missouri State Highway Patrol. Mainly peaceful protests continued for several weeks.<\/p>\n<p>A few days after the shooting, the Ferguson Police Department released a video of events at a nearby convenience store that occurred only minutes before the shooting. It shows Brown taking cigarillos and shoving a store employee who tried to prevent him from leaving. The timing of the video release received criticism from some media, the Brown family, and some public officials, who viewed the release as an attempt to besmirch Brown. Others said the video was informative as to Brown's state of mind, with the shooting incident coming so shortly after the robbery, and according to Wilson, the recent police dispatch of the convenience store theft was a factor in his decision to confront Brown.<\/p>\n<p>The events surrounding the shooting were investigated by a county grand jury. In a press conference on November 24, Robert P. McCulloch, the Prosecuting Attorney for St. Louis County, Missouri, announced that the jury had decided not to indict Darren Wilson for his actions. Some legal analysts raised concerns over McCulloch's unorthodox approach, asserting that this process could have influenced the grand jury to decide not to indict. One commentator said that it was \"not unusual in a police-involved shooting case for a prosecutor to lay out all the evidence and not ask a grand jury for a specific criminal charge\", while others highlighted significant differences between a typical grand jury proceeding in Missouri and Wilson's case.<\/p>\n<p>In September, Eric Holder, the U.S. Attorney General, launched a federal investigation of the Missouri city's police force to examine whether officers routinely engaged in racial profiling or showed a pattern of excessive force. On December 1, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that the federal government will spend US$75 million on body cameras for law enforcement officers, as one of the measures taken in response to the shooting.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2012-04-22T13:40:01","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown","item_count":526,"category":"Person","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":1,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=96944","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/96944\/","daily_count":3,"id":96944,"muted_by_default":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/oakland-police-department\/","name":"Oakland Police Department","local_url":"\/topic\/oakland-police-department\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/0f\/CA_-_Oakland_Police.png","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:08:23.805914","active":true,"links":"","kind":"tag","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/ZNm","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=96944","latitude":null,"slug":"oakland-police-department","description":"<p>The <b>Oakland Police Department<\/b> (<b>OPD<\/b>) is a civilian law enforcement agency responsible for policing the city of Oakland, California.

Inhabitants of Sydney are called <i>Sydneysiders<\/i>, comprising a cosmopolitan and international population. Sydney has been referred to as the most multicultural city in Australia and one of the most multicultural cities in the world.<\/p>\n<p>The site of the first British colony in Australia, Sydney was established in 1788 at Sydney Cove by Captain Arthur Phillip, of the First Fleet, as a penal colony. The city is built on hills surrounding one of the world's largest natural harbours, Port Jackson, which is commonly known as Sydney Harbour, where the iconic Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge are prominent structures. The hinterland of the metropolitan area is surrounded by national parks, and the coastal regions feature many bays, rivers, inlets and beaches, including the famous Bondi and Manly beaches. Within the city are many parklands, including Hyde Park and the Royal Botanic Gardens.<\/p>\n<p>Sydney has hosted multiple major international sporting events, including the 1938 British Empire Games (now known as the Commonwealth Games), the 2000 Summer Olympics and the final of the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

On this day, he was initially approached by police officer Justin Damico. A fellow officer, Daniel Pantaleo, put Garner on the ground by the use of force after Garner refused to be handcuffed and swatted at officers, Pantaleo using his arms around the much taller Garner's head, applying a headlock or chokehold shown in a widely viewed video recording of the event. Garner died some minutes later. NYPD Union leader Patrick Lynch challenged the claim that a chokehold was used.<\/p>\n<p>On August 1, 2014, city medical examiners concluded that Garner was killed by neck compression from the chokehold along with “the compression of his chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police”. Asthma, heart disease and obesity were contributing factors. As a result of Garner's death, four EMTs and paramedics who responded to Garner's death were suspended without pay on July 21, 2014, and officers Justin Damico and Daniel Pantaleo were placed on desk duty, the latter stripped of his service gun and badge.<\/p>\n<p>The event stirred public protests and rallies with charges of police brutality and was broadcast nationally over various media networks.<\/p>\n<p>On December 3, 2014, a grand jury decided not to indict Daniel Pantaleo, the officer involved in Garner's death.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Death_of_Eric_Garner\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2014-07-23T14:19:06.394895","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Death_of_Eric_Garner","item_count":340,"category":"CrimeCourtsEvent","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":7,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"off","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=78","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/78\/","daily_count":8,"id":78,"name":"Obama 2nd term nominations","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/obama-cabinet-nominees\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/obama-cabinet-nominees\/","image_url":"","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:31:20.418532","active":true,"links":"","kind":"arc","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BQ","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=78","latitude":null,"slug":"obama-cabinet-nominees","description":"<p>Follow updates on the nominations for key positions during President Obama's second term in office.<\/p>\r\n\r\n","image_credit":"","created_on":"2013-01-17T00:50:07","wikipedia_url":"","item_count":357,"category":"PoliticsEvent","livevideo":""},{"recent_count":1,"woeid":null,"geohash":"","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75616","placetype":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75616\/","daily_count":7,"id":75616,"name":"Ferguson, Mo., unrest 2014 ","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/teenager-shot-killed-in-ferguson-apartment-complex\/","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/teenager-shot-killed-in-ferguson-apartment-complex\/","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/76\/Ferguson_Day_6%2C_Picture_44.png","latest_item_date":"2014-12-15T23:08:23.805914","active":true,"links":"","kind":"arc","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Tpm","moderation_status":"approved","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75616","latitude":null,"slug":"teenager-shot-killed-in-ferguson-apartment-complex","description":"<p>Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed on Aug. 9, 2014 by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis.

He predicted that at least 10,000 citizens would join the protest to take over Central in July 2014 if the universal suffrage for the 2017 Chief Executive election and 2020 Legislative Council Elections would not be carried out according to the \"international standards\".<\/p>\n<p>Observers noted that the occupy movement campaign would likely occur after Qiao Xiaoyang, chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress Law Committee, stated that chief executive candidates were required to love both the country (China) and Hong Kong, and not confront the central government, effectively excluding candidates from the opposition pro-democracy camp. This was confirmed on 31 August 2014 when the NPC stated that the election for the chief executive of Hong Kong SAR being part of China would, in effect, be restricted to the candidates supportive of the Chinese central government.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Occupy_Central_with_Love_and_Peace\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2014-07-01T08:30:10.106947","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Occupy_Central_with_Love_and_Peace","item_count":354,"category":"PoliticsEvent","livevideo":""}],"meta":{"limit":10,"previous":null,"offset":0,"next":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?limit=10&offset=10&order_by=-daily_count&daily_count__gt=0&muted_by_default=False"}}
