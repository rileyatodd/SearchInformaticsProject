There's Mike Huckabee ('08 run) and Rick Santorum ('12). And there's still the possibility that Romney could make another run (after his previous bids in '08 and '12). So call 2016 the year of the political re-run, or spinoff. The familiar names, however, do make sense in this respect: The country went new in 2008 (with Obama), but the nation doesn't seem as idealistic as it was back then. Also, familiar names and repeat presidential candidates litter American history -- the Adamses, the Bushes, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan. The question is whether Barbara Bush's <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/25/barbara-bush-jeb-bush-president_n_3154029.html\">words to NBC's Matt Lauer in 2013</a> strike a chord with the American public: &quot;It's a great country.

And here was Vice President Dick Cheney defending those practices on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; yesterday, saying he had no regrets - even when it came to those who turned out to be innocent or who died from the interrogation practices: &quot;I have no problem as long as we achieve our objective. And our objective is to get the guys who did 9/11 and it is to avoid another attack against the United States. I was prepared and we did. We got authorizing from the president and authorization from the Justice Department to go forward with the program. It worked. It worked now for 13 years.&quot; More Cheney: &quot;We've avoided another mass casualty attack against the United States. And we did capture Bin Laden. We did capture an awful lot of the senior guys at Al Qaeda who were responsible for that attack on 9/11.
