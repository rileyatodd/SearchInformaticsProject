Nearly a quarter of all young adults ages 18-34 returned home because of economic conditions post-recession, according to the Pew Research Center.

As many as one in three former foster care youth experience homelessness after exiting foster care, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reported last May."},{"type":"p","html":"Many foster youth age out of the system without having obtained a high school diploma and with few, if any assets, to their name, according to a recent HUD report. They are also more likely to have experienced teen pregnancy, to have a criminal record, and to suffer from a mental health and/or substance disorder. Often, former foster youth lack basic workplace skills, such as how to fill out a job application. In addition, they tend to have a shortage of supportive adults in their life who can connect them with employers.

Rather than entering the adult shelter system, they often &quot;couch-surf,&quot; or double-up, moving in with friends or relatives. In 2014, 71 percent of homeless students reported doubling-up as their primary nighttime residence, a recent Department of Education report stated. Since these youths appear to have housing and are so infrequently on the streets, there is little to no existing data on their demographics, their location, or the duration of their homelessness."},{"type":"p","html":"&quot;You ask a young person, 'Are you homeless?,' a lot of times, they'll say no.

She hopes to someday attend graduate school to become a therapist, but for now, her priority remains finding a stable place to live."},{"type":"p","html":"&quot;I want to use my experience with [homelessness] to help other people,&quot; Freeman said. &quot;[But] I [can't] really do school if I'm in the street, switching from place to place.

At one time, we were talking about access to education, a stable job that made it possible to buy a home. Things like the GI bill, union salaries, and pensions secured the middle class, but increasingly, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/in-plain-sight/two-americas-many-brace-have-not-holiday-season-n238536\">these things are relics</a>. When you talk about the middle class, what are you talking about?"},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>Perez</strong>: The middle class is a timeless concept that is as much a values set as it is a number that denotes median family income. The values part is about people who have the capacity to have a home, retirement, healthcare and employment security. It’s the ability for people to help their children do a little better than they did. That’s the moral contract, and that’s what makes us the greatest country on earth."},{"type":"p","html":"The challenge out of the Great Recession is to ensure that we continue to maintain this social compact with America. And we must continue to strive to ensure that we have shared prosperity. We see encouraging job growth, and we’re on pace to have more; the challenge is to make sure that the rising tide lifts all boats and not simply the yachts. There is an argument that low wages are a product of globalization. But low wages are a choice, not a necessity. In every business model across America I can give you examples of employers that reject the false choice between the shareholder, worker, and customer."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>NBC</strong>: Yet because the minimum wage remains at an historic low in terms of buying power, many employers are making the opposite choice: to cut worker pay and impose difficult scheduling policies to grow profits. Among the workers at the bottom of the scale are <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/minimum-wage-fight-turns-tips-n153046\">tipped workers</a> who are entitled to just $2.13 per hour under federal minimum wages law. So, what percent do you tip? And how much are we supposed to tip, say, at a coffee shop when you buy a $1.85 cup of coffee. What does the Secretary of Labor put in the tip jar for the barista?"},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>Perez</strong>: Well, I am the wrong guy to ask. I save a lot of money because I don’t drink coffee, because I don’t go to Starbucks. I don’t drink tea either. It’s healthier. Look at me I’m drinking water."},{"type":"p","html":"It’s interesting: I’ve traveled internationally a fair amount recently, and I always ask what the custom is around tipping. In Spain I was instructed not to tip at all. I bring this up because restaurateurs there say it is their responsibility to pay their workers fairly. That’s not how it works here, and as a result while everyone has monthly overhead—rent utilities and the like—when you’re a tipped worker, you have no guarantee of how much money will come in. That’s colossally unfair. When the government shut down, I’d go into restaurants that were ordinarily packed at lunchtime and they were ghost towns, and those workers relied on tips, but they were not going to get that money back."},{"type":"blockquote","html":"<p>&quot;It’s understandable that there continues to be angst.&quot;</p>","class":"pullquote"},{"type":"p","html":"All too frequently, while an employer is supposed to compensate them for the difference between $2.13 and the full minimum wage, that does not always happen. That’s why my office has a pretty aggressive enforcement operation going after back wages and penalties for employers who don’t pay. The federal minimum wage is too low to begin with and the tipped wage results in tipped workers, disproportionately women, really taking it on the chin."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>NBC</strong>: Speaking of disproportionality, racial inequality is a persistent feature of the economy—unemployment and underemployment rates are<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/in-plain-sight/dying-out-here-u-s-job-gains-leave-black-women-n202376\"> higher in communities of color</a>. How is your department addressing persistent racial inequality in work?"},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>Perez</strong>: There is not one magic bullet. If there was one magic bullet to increase wages and to ensure shared prosperity that bullet would have been shot. There are many things that we need to do. For one, 70 percent of GDP growth is from consumption, and we need to take actions to stimulate consumption, including but not limited to raising the minimum wage."},{"type":"p","html":"More broadly, we are dramatically reforming how we upscale America. I was at Lorraine County Community College this morning talking to people who were out of work, surviving on public benefits and have now punched their ticket to the middle class because they got onto the skills super highway that we are constructing. It’s allowed them to get the skills that match them with in demand jobs."},{"type":"p","html":"When you look at unemployment rates, they’re coming down for all demographics. But at the same time, the African American and Latino unemployment rates were higher, so even though they’re coming down, but they are still unconscionably high. If you look at where it was a year ago, and where it is now, it’s moving in the right direction, but it’s all too slow."},{"type":"p","html":"For black workers, if you look at incarceration rates of young black men compared to the rest of the population, they are very high. We have done a number of investments, often in partnership with the Department of Justice, to help people coming out of prison, including but not limited to young black men, to have access to the skills they need, and the support systems they need to get access to a job and not recidivate."},{"type":"blockquote","html":"<p>&quot;If there was one magic bullet to increase wages ... that bullet would have been shot.&quot;</p>","class":"pullquote"},{"type":"p","html":"At the same the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] has been looking into the use of criminal histories as a filter in the hiring process and whether that implicates Title VII [anti-discrimination laws].

It is also one of the most prolific employers of former offenders. They are not doing it as an act of charity. They are doing it because they find a great, loyal and productive workforce."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>NBC</strong>: Young workers are also having a tough time in this recovery. Many internships in the U.S. <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/in-plain-sight/no-one-should-have-work-free-end-unpaid-internship-v20262899\">are unpaid</a>, so college and post-college aged people work for free because it’s “good experience.” The Labor Department has <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-labor-department-let-companies-off-hook-for-unpaid-internships\">issued guidelines</a> saying an intern can be unpaid if they’re doing work that furthers their education and that a paid employee wouldn’t do otherwise. Yet recent reporting has shown that the DOL has not prioritized enforcement of internship laws."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>Perez</strong>: We do have an active [enforcement] focus on the individual cases of folks who should be classified as employees but are treated as interns and we’ll continue to do that, but at the same time if your focus is entirely on strategies to use enforcement to make sure that you get people into the workforce to make money, I think at best we’ll see fleeting progress."},{"type":"p","html":"So we’re looking to alternatives. I was in the U.K. and Germany and went to Volkswagen and learned about their apprenticeship model—young people become paid apprentices in trades. It’s not a coincidence that youth unemployment is far lower in Germany than the United States because there are paid opportunities for young people to get experience. So, yes we need to and do investigate [internship violations], but I think the broader solution will help more people faster to transform the culture of America around this earn-while-you-learn idea."},{"type":"blockquote","html":"<p>&quot;It’s not a coincidence that youth unemployment is far lower in Germany.&quot;</p>","class":"pullquote"},{"type":"p","html":"We’re going to do a $100 million competitive grant to help develop apprenticeship models in the U.S. I expect that a typical recipient will be a partnership that will include business, non-profits and educators that will not be focused only on skilled trades, but also in emerging areas like healthcare, cyber security, IT. I expect that these grants will help get minorities and women into apprenticeships."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>NBC</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/in-plain-sight/whats-making-these-selma-alabama-auto-parts-workers-so-sick-n150136\">I wrote a story</a> about workers in a foam plant in Selma, Alabama, that that sells cushions to Hyundai. Workers say that chemicals in the plant are making them sick, and they want to hold their employer accountable, but they say it’s not entirely clear if they should complain to Hyundai or the contractor that employs them directly. Subcontracting like this has reshaped the American labor market, and for workers, that can be a tremendous challenge."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>Perez</strong>: You’re talking about the fissured workplace. When we talk about the challenges of shared prosperity, the fissured workplace poses a challenge to shared prosperity. The fissured workplace has different forms—there are workers that act like and quack like employees but are called contract workers. There are business models that contract out essential services, like in your story."},{"type":"p","html":"In your story, you wrote about Denise Barnett [a worker at the Alabama plant]. What she’s dealing with, I see that all the time: accountability becomes and feels unclear."},{"type":"p","html":"If we are going to build shared prosperity in society and address wage challenges that you and I have discussed, we need to make sure we treat people as employees.

And there is a general feeling that with no representation on the school board and 19 miles of often-clogged, albeit scenic highway separating the two cities, leaders in Santa Monica don’t really care what is happening at Malibu schools. It is a claim that the superintendent Sandra Lyon and many school board members would contest."},{"type":"p","html":"But perhaps, most agitating to Malibu parents, was a recent a change in the district’s PTA fundraising policy, spearheaded by its new superintendent, to create more equitable offerings between schools. The policy has outraged Malibu parents, because it now prohibits them from a long-held practice of pumping private dollars into schools for the hiring of teaching aides, something many Santa Monica schools could not afford to do."},{"type":"p","html":"Farrer says outsiders often look at the two cities and assume that Malibu has the upper hand. “They have always looked at us as an elite pampered place and, in a lot of cases, our conditions are substandard,” she said of Malibu’s public schools. “We are geographically isolated and outnumbered.”"},{"type":"p","html":"Malibu does have more money. The median household income is$135,530, according to the United States Census Bureau, close to double that of Santa Monica. And Santa Monica educates more at-risk students. About 30 percent of the students at Santa Monica High School, which is 41 percent white, receive free or reduced lunch, compared to 12 percent at Malibu High School, which is about 80 percent white."},{"type":"p","html":"But with 12,861 residents - compared to Santa Monica’s 92,472 - it has been historically challenging for Malibu parents to get their residents on the seven- member school board.

That’s why he’s trying to win universal support."},{"type":"p","html":"He added that the time and energy these officials have had to spend on disgruntled residents from Malibu begging for an out may end up playing a significant role in Santa Monica’s decision to support the break. “This isn’t just local control for us,” he said. “It’s local control for them.

In 2013, New Mexico’s governor signed a law that creates an abbreviated parental leave policy for high school students. The first of its kind in the nation, the law requires that all school districts provide parents with 10 days off after the birth of a child and another four days for a baby’s doctor’s appointments or to care for a sick child. That’s on top of the permitted 10 days of unexcused absences for all students."},{"type":"p","html":"“This is about education,” said Denicia Cadena, an organizer with Young Women United, a community-organizing group that led efforts to pass the legislation last year. “We all say over and over again that every child deserves an education.

Her mother had agreed to take care of the baby; Ramirez’s boyfriend would help too, when he wasn’t away on a construction job in another city.

That’s according to <a href=\"https://www.russellsage.org/publications/unequal-time\">Unequal Time</a>, a new book by University of Massachusetts sociologists <a href=\"http://www.umass.edu/sociol/faculty_staff/bios/clawson.html\">Dan Clawson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.umass.edu/sociol/faculty_staff/bios/gerstel.html\">Naomi Gerstel</a> that was published on Tuesday. “Across the health sector, work has become increasingly unpredictable,” Clawson says. “And it’s low-wage workers and women whose lives are thrown most into chaos.”"},{"type":"p","html":"Clawson and Gerstel interviewed dozens of workers, including one certified nursing assistant who she worked unpredictable hours in a nursing home and was expected to come in even when sick. “They say a sore throat is not really a sore throat,” the nurse’s aide told the authors."},{"type":"p","html":"In an interview about his new book, Clawson told NBC that the practices workers like this one described have become commonplace."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>NBC: You studied doctors, nurses, EMTs and nursing assistants, and found that the sector has become increasingly unpredictable for workers across the spectrum. But you say that nursing assistants, overwhelmingly women and relatively low-paid, are hardest hit.</strong>"},{"type":"p","html":"Clawson: The thing about health care is that there has to be someone on duty all the time. You can’t have a nurse walk off and have the patients not covered for an hour. That’s uncontroversial, but the way that plays out is unequal by gender and class, and it’s absolutely unsustainable for the lives of low wage workers and women."},{"type":"p","html":"We studied a high-end nursing home, for example. Most patients are in private rooms, there are a stable number of beds and a stable number of workers. Yet even in this highly controlled setting, we found that over a third of nursing assistant shifts were unpredictable: either they were working an unplanned shift or not working a planned shift. There’s a tremendous amount of unpredictability and churning in a workplace that should be the most stable of employment situations. It’s likely worse in other homes."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>NBC: What does that mean for workers? Couldn’t that flexibility really be a good thing for workers with families? You call it unpredictability. But couldn’t it be a result of workers choosing to change their shifts? </strong>"},{"type":"p","html":"Clawson: The question of choice or not choice is a false dichotomy. Employees in the nursing assistant position are usually scheduled for three or four 8-hour shifts a week. They know they’ll have these shifts. But that’s only 24 or 32 hours a week, and workers need 40 hours to be able to come close to supporting their families [nursing assistants, about 90 percent of whom are women, make an average of about $10 an hour]. So when they’re told to come in for a shift that they didn’t plan, they really have no choice. They know every week that they’ll work 8 or 16 hours unpredictably, and they have to work the shifts because they have to pay rent. Many of these workers are women with kids, often single mothers—they happen mostly to be women of color—and so they have to work as many hours as they can. It makes it very hard to schedule the rest of life, to make arrangements with other relatives to care for kids. The key thing is that their lives have to be always at the disposal of the employer, even when sick."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>NBC: So how does this function differently for higher paid or more male-dominated parts of the health sector?</strong>"},{"type":"p","html":"Clawson:<strong> </strong>Some parts of what I’m describing are creeping into the work lives of nurses. One major hospital scheduled nurses for 40 hours per week but the hospital reserved the right to cancel the shift up to two hours before it began. It’s starting to affect higher paid workers too, but less so."},{"type":"p","html":"For doctors it’s a different situation, where rather than working an extra shift, they are much more likely to work late because they are working with a patient and are expected to stay until they’re finished. And the thing we found is that half of doctors—who are more likely to be men—had stay at home partners. Others have people they can pay to care for their children. They maybe eat dinner late, but there’s someone caring for the kids."},{"type":"p","html":"Another thing we found was that as unpredictability gets worse for lower wage workers, in the more privileged occupations, structural adaptations have been created to help address the problems of unpredictability. There’s now a whole doctor specialist called the “hospitalist” whose job it is to check on the patients and relieve other doctors of long hours."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>NBC: You quote workers talking about coming to work while sick because they have so little control over their hours and sick days. There’s also been a lot of criticism of elder neglect in nursing homes, of patients who are not properly cared for. How do the scheduling practices you researched affect the well being of patients?</strong>"},{"type":"p","html":"Clawson: Another gender and class difference in the health sector is about how punitive the scheduling policies are. In many workplaces, like the ones we studied, nursing assistants got six days a year of paid sick leave, but if they used more than four of those days in any 90-day period, they lost their jobs. If you think of it from the perspective of a single mother with kids, the younger kid gets sick and then the other kid gets sick and you get sick, you use up the time. One more, you’re fired."},{"type":"p","html":"Because of these practices, when workers got sick, they made every effort to come in anyway. In these jobs, a sore throat is not really a sore throat. Nursing assistants are coerced to come in when sick because otherwise they may lose their job. And this is while they are feeding, washing and caring for 90-year-olds who are in poor health."},{"type":"p","html":"And we can see that a hospital has every incentive not to collect information on sick workers. There is no record."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>NBC: This sounds very hard for workers, but as you said before, healthcare is not a field where you can simply be understaffed. So how do you avoid the kind of destructive unpredictability?</strong>"},{"type":"p","html":"Clawson: Within healthcare there’s a duty of care: you are required to stay with a patient and can’t leave till there’s alternative coverage. But what we know is that employers are staffing shifts in a very lean way, which means that there’s no slack in the system. The leaner the staff, the more you’ve cut to the bone, the more disruptive every change becomes. The staffing is leaner because increasing profits are central now to the success of the organization. But it would be better for patients and hospital and residents of nursing homes if there were more people available to take care of patients."},{"type":"p","html":"This is part of a shift toward greater inequality, toward jobs that are more insecure, and contracted out, and that don’t provide the stability and advancement that they used to.
