                                        <p>The Victorian Electoral Commission has finished data entry for the Legisltive Council and this morning from 9:30 will hit the button for the electronic distribution of preferences. As the official results are announced, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/vic-election-2014/results/legislative-council/" target="_blank">I will update the output of my election calculator on the ABC Victorian election site</a>.</p>
<p>The calculator has operated by assuming all votes are group ticket votes with the party&#39;s lodged preference ticket. In fact around 8% of voters were cast below the line and therefore will not follow the party ticket. As only 1-5 were required as preferences for a formal below the line vote, there will be ballot papers that exhaust their preferences towards the end of the count.</p>
<p>In my view this will make a difference in only two regions.</p>
<p>I think the Greens are most likely to win the final seat in South Eastern Metropolitan Region. Assuming all votes were ticket votes, the calculator predicts the last seat will be won by the Sex Party. I think the Sex Party victory is too reliant on ticket votes to survive the actual distribution of preferences.</p>
<p>The calculator currently predicts that Vote 1 Local Jobs will win the final seat in Western Victoria Region. I think it is possible this will be overturned by the actual distribution, but we will have to wait for the actual distribution.</p>

				<p>A quick break from my sick bed to publish a post-election pendulum. Sorry for the brevity but I can only type with difficulty at the moment.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll make a couple of comments that refer back to the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/vic-election-2014/guide/pendulum/" target="_blank">pre-election pendulum</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll have a final figure tomorrow (Friday), but the state-wide 2-party preferred percentage vote for Labor is about 52.0%. That represents a swing of about 3.6%.</p>
<p>If you include Frankston as a Coalition seat, there were 9 Coalition seats on the pendulum with margins under 3%. Labor gained 8 of these seats.</p>

				<p>For the next two months there are highly unlikely to be any posts published on this blog.</p>
<p>On Monday 8 December I am having shoulder surgery to repear a rotor cuff tear. This will put me in a sling for six weeks followed by rehab.</p>
<p>The operation is on my right shoulder, and being right handed, this will leave me typing left handed for the next six weeks. I am a very bad left-handed typist so am extremely unlikely to be writing any posts.</p>
<p>It will be good to get the operation done as I&#39;ve been carrying the injury since April this year. I damaged the shoulder in a bike accident, but the tear happened several days later due to a gardening injury. Most of the pain has subsided, but the tear is large enough that an operation is necessary for me to return to normal strength and resume a normal lifestyle.</p>
<p>The extended break means I won&#39;t be doing any commentary on the final lower house results in Victoria, or on the slowly unfolding Legislative Council count.</p>
<p>The Legislative Council calculators will continue to run, and hopefully I can also find a way to finalise the lower house results on the ABC website.</p>
<p>I will also be covering the Fisher by-election tonight, and will update the check-count figures on Sunday, but I am not sure when I can arrange for the final figures to be published.</p>
<p>So after Sunday there will be a long silent pause from me. It will be a painful and rather frustrating Christmas and New Year &#0160;for me, but I hope all my readers have a more joyous time.</p>
<p>See you all again in late January, and hopefully I&#39;ll be fit for the Queensland and New South wales elections.</p>

				<p>At the end of election night, the ABC computer&#39;s predictive tools were turned off for the lower house. This means all predictions are now based on actual counts. This has changed the number of doubtful seats.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/vic-election-2014/results/" target="_self">The ABC results site can be found at this link</a>)</p>
<p>Bentleigh and Frankston are put back into the doubtful category, but I suspect they will both be won by Labor. The formula used to give seats away is based on the current vote lead and the percentage of the vote counted. The high pre-poll vote means the turnout is low, so the formula pushes both seats into the doubtful category. My feeling is the pre-poll votes will not change the current Labor lead, but I will leave the formulas to run with the usual setting.</p>
<p>Melbourne &#0160;has also fallen back into the doubtful category for the same reason, but I expect the Greens to win unless there is something remarkable with the pre-poll and absent vote.</p>
<p>Prahran is truly in doubt. Turning off predictive tools put Liberal Clem Newton-Brown back in front, but very narrowly. The turnout at the moment is only 49.5% with all polling places and a sample of postal votes counted. The result will be decided by pre-poll votes as well as Prahran&#39;s traditionally high absent vote. The Liberals are in trouble, but Labor&#39;s Neil Pharaoh is only 42 votes ahead of Green Sam Hibbins in the race for second spot. All three parties have a chance of winning with so many votes to count, though &#0160;my hunch is that Labor is slightly favoured.</p>
<p>Morwell is another seat to watch. National Russell Northe is around 800 votes ahead, but Labor believes the presence of the pre-poll voting centre in Morwell will greatly assist Labor&#39;s bid to hold the seat. Again, there is a lot more counting to come.</p>
<p>The ABC&#39;s election computers are in transit today and it will be impossible to update lower house figures. I am not sure how much fresh counting the VEC will do today, but it cannot be updated to the ABC&#39;s computer.</p>
<p>The Legislative Council calculators will continue to be updated, though I do not know how much new voting will be conducted today. Current numbers point to six micro-parties being elected, three from the Shooters and Fishers plus one each from the DLP, Sex Party and Australian Country Alliance.</p>
<p>The huge pre-poll vote and the fine cut-off points in the distribiution of preferences makes it difficult to be certain of these predictions at this stage. The use of below the line optional preferential voting&#0160;in Victoria may yet play a part in whether preference harvesting is successful in electing all six micro-parties.</p>

				<p>The table below summarises the effective turnout at 6pm on the Friday evening before polling day. It is calculated by dividing postal votes received and pre-poll votes cast by the enrolment for each electorate.</p>
<p>Overall around 30% of Victorians have already voted. The VEC will count up to 2,000 postal votes in each district on Saturday night, but not pre-poll votes.</p>
<p>This means the final turnout figure on Saturday night will be in the range 65-70%.</p>

				<p>The 2014 Victoria election is set to see a record number of electors cast their ballots before polling day.</p>
<p>By this morning, Wednesday 26 Nov 2014, three days before polling day, close to 650,000 Victorians have taken the opportunity to vote either in-person at a pre-poll voting centre, or from home or elsewhere by post.</p>
<p>That compares to 543,763 pre-poll votes in 2010, and 247,642 postal votes at the 2014 election.</p>
<p>At the moment the ratio of pre-poll to postal votes is around 4 to 1 compared to 2 to 1 in 2010, but these last few days are when the bulk of postal votes are returned, so this ratio is likely to change.</p>
<p>It seems certain that the number of pre-poll and postal votes will surpass the 2010 totals by polling day, and this will have an impact on how results are reported on election night.</p>
<p>How this may impact is explained by the following tables.</p>

				<p>The most common questions I receive at this blog concern how preferential voting works and what is the best way to vote.</p>
<p>How do I vote? What is the most strategic way to vote? How can I deny my preferences to one of the major parties.</p>
<p>Let me go right back to basics and explain what a voter should do when they vote.</p>
