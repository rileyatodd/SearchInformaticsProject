  <p><strong><em>Following the Sydney siege, we must avoid defaulting to the view that any criminal act that includes a garbled interpretation of the Islamic message is part of a planned, pre-meditated and co-ordinated attack, writes John Blaxland.</em></strong></p><p>The hostage incident in Sydney's Martin Place has been resolved with the captor, a recent convert from Shia to Sunni Islam with a criminal record killed, along with two hostages and several others injured.</p><p>Yet this bizarre incident and the strange circumstances raises more questions than it answers.</p><p>Is this a symptom of an emerging civilizational "War Amongst the People" or the act of just another unhinged lone madman?</p><p>Sympathy notes from Canada's PM Stephen Harper and India's Narendra Modi point to the echoes of terrorist incidents at Mumbai's Taj Mahal Hotel in 2008 and the recent shootings at Ottawa's War Memorial and Parliament House. But how much caution should we exercise in responding on this premise?</p><p>There is a growing popular inclination to see this as part of a global initiative - an existential threat to the world under siege from fundamentalist Islamist extremism.</p><p>There are also those disposed to react against the otherness of Islam and the extremism this incident appears to demonstrate. The motivations of the captor appear to reflect a garbled and fringe interpretation of the Islamic message.</p><p>Stories of other threatening signs at other Sydney landmarks reinforce the fears and perceptions that this was a planned, pre-mediated and co-ordinated act.</p><p>Yet it is vitally important to avoid simply defaulting to this view. Now is not the time for shrill or emotive reactions.</p><p>Instead a cool, careful and collected response is required to prevent this incident further polarising, alienating or inciting long-established but sometimes marginalised elements of our multicultural community.</p><p>Yet as we seek to connect the dots, with international parallels and other domestic incidents pointing to trouble brewing, it seem clear we have a problem. But just how big is it?</p><p>On its own, a hostage incident like this would be discounted as the work of a madman. That view would be confirmed were there to be, say, a fascist banner or the demands of a resentful estranged parent rather than a Muslim banner on display in the shop window. It would be seen as a relatively insignificant crime that may or may not have made headlines beyond Australian shores.</p><p>It seems clear however that, like the lone and unhinged zealot in Ottawa who was a recent convert to Islam, this criminal has acted with the media spotlight in mind, selecting a shop across the road from television studios in Martin Place.</p><p>The banner displayed carried a universal Muslim message - The Shahada - reiterating the belief in Allah as the one true God and Mohammad as his messenger. The banner was not the one now most commonly associated with the so-called Islamic State. But the incident echoes the sentiment expressed by its leader Al Baghdadi, who has called for such acts of violence against non-believers.</p><p>Indeed, the Islamic edge to this incident feeds the growing concern about further prospects of violent jihadist extremism.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant message to emerge as the incident unfolded was the one published by the Australian National Imam's Council, which "unequivocally" condemned this criminal act, declaring that "such actions are denounced in part and in whole in Islam".</p><p>This heartening message demonstrates a resolve to discredit the incident as unworthy of any endorsement as a pious act that could possibly warrant even tacit support.</p><p>To be sure, there are parts of the Koran that refer to unspeakable acts of barbarity against non-Muslims. But there are also many parts of the holy texts of other religions that are downright brutal as well - not the least of which is the Old Testament in the Bible.</p><p>For the overwhelming majority of adherents of major world religions those harsh texts are hardly central tenets of faith. Thankfully Jesus's teachings in the New Testament stressed the virtues of loving ones neighbour and turning the other cheek.</p><p>Even though the captor claimed his actions were linked to the conflict in Iraq that does not prove that Australia's military actions there triggered it. The perpetrator already had a track record of unrelated violence. Conversely, it also seems to demonstrate that no matter how effective, precise and capable our soldiers, sailors and airmen may be in performing their duties in Iraq, defeating the so-called Islamic State in Iraq can do little to address the internal security challenges faced within Australia.</p><p>The argument that operations there make us safer here ring hollow.</p><p>At the same time, the scale of the incident was an existential one, but only for those directly facing the barrel of the captor's weapon. The idea of this being symptomatic of a broader existential threat to society is overstated.</p><p>Yet it is important for us all as Australians to respond graciously, respectfully and lawfully, trusting that the institutions of state, the police and security authorities, are the ones to manage aberrant behaviour.</p><p>As we do so, we should bear in mind John Dickson's <a href="/news/2014-09-30/dickson-a-letter-to-my-church-about-islam/5779590" target="_self" title="">wise exhortation on The Drum a few weeks back</a> to reach out a hand of friendship to strangers who may be feeling uneasy, threatened or marginalised.</p><p>The Prime Minister spoke of Australia as a peaceful, open and generous society. He's right on that point. But the future of our peaceful multicultural nation cannot be taken for granted. The captor's message and his agenda must be countered by us all rejecting the messages of hate, fear, disrespect and of violence.</p><p><em>John Blaxland is a senior fellow at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at the Australian National University.

	<p>In my opinion it is much too early to be going into the whys and wherefores of this event.<br /><br />Plenty of time for that when more of the facts are really known.<br /><br />For now why not just show some respect for the families of the two hostages killed.<br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>The writer actually follows your premise by commenting on assumptions already near virulent.  All of us have to deal with depths of inner chaos and, when we see it surface in others as violence against all that holds it back, we are in danger of being ourselves overwhelmed by our own.  So it is projected onto others and we unleash the exact same maelstrom on them -if we are not careful.  A cabby I road with yesterday was seething with the same rage the perpetrator no doubt felt.  Both of them rationalise it as defending a way of life - both of them are awfully mistaken and so very dangerous to others.</p>

	<p>Excellent comment Vocans.  We focus on the differences in views expressed, not the similarities in the underlying emotional feelings.  We think we are different because we see the world differently when in fact we are responding to the same emotional feelings in a very similar same way.  Moreover, we want an authoritarian crackdown as a mode of &quot;control&quot; rather than seeing understanding as a more useful path in the longer term.</p>

	<p>So you feel your cabbie is likely to attack and kill as a result of his anger?  I am surprised you did not dive from the moving vehicle.<br /><br />Of course you didn't.<br /><br />There is a difference in anger directed against someone who wants to kill, and anger at the world for some fanatical religious reason.</p>

	<p>&quot;Lone madman or a networked holy warrior?&quot; ... how does that headline help people deal with their inner chaos?<br /><br />I know a young woman who lost her parents in that plane shot down over the Ukraine. She spoke about how difficult it was hearing &quot;news&quot; reports regarding that event, most of which were wrong.<br /><br />Show respect to those that have lost a love one and give this sort of emotive articles a rest.

	<p>In this case I gather last week the gunman lost the case he took to the High Court, in which he argued that he should be allowed to issue threats to the families of Australians serving/killed in Afghanistan. I'm not sure that his kind of nuttiness is conducive to friendly hands. He had a long list of offences and clearly had a problem with resorting to violence - especially if the charge of being an accessory in his ex-wife's murder was upheld. It would be a great pity if Muslims in Australia get treated badly because of what is tangential connection to this man. <br /><br /></p>

	<p>On the contrary, we need to start questioning now to make sure there are no more nuts like this out there.<br /><br />We can start by asking how someone who was clearly deranged and highly dangerous was allowed out on bail. If the judge even had the option to detain him but didn't we need to know why not. A highly dubious decision that has now cost two lives.</p>

	<p>That is the disturbing element - in Victoria in recent years we have had instances of convicted murderers released on parole who have gone on to commit similar murders, in one case after serving another term for murder. We also had the murder of Jill Maher where the offender was actually on bail for a violent offence and had committed another crime just before that in which his bail status was overlooked. <br /><br />These instances like the Sydney tragedy point to a legal system that is skewed towards allowing violent offenders bail when in fact they should be held on remand. I would be asking questions about the gullibility of judges, parole boards and magistrates as well as addressing the rising examples of radicalization of fringe dwellers and the mentally ill.</p>

We already have tough laws that give the government all the powers they could possibly need to stop this sort of thing but did it help?<br /><br />A days rest from the obsession with this senseless killing seems too much to ask. We haven't gone 24 hours and we are getting headlines like  ... &quot;Lone madman or a networked holy warrior?&quot;  <br /><br />Nonsense.<br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>@the yank:<br />Yes, it is way to early to go into the whys and wherefores. There is however a message to be learned and that message is that the media completely played into the hands of this criminal. He sought publicity and thanks to our overly reactive media he achieved his ambition in bucket loads. If the media had adopted a low key and responsible approach the end result of this tragedy may well have been very different. They were sucked in on a slow news day (only Joe and the budget woe) and their strident non stop reporting merely aggravated an already tense situation.</p>

	<p>I agree with JohnC.   The media, while they did follow police instructions not to disclose certain information they were aware of did go somewhat overboard.<br /><br />It's interesting to note that there seems to be a general policy of not reporting suicides in this country for fear of creating copycats.   Why oh why can't they adopt the same sort of measured approach to situations where many lives could end up being at risk?<br /><br />Too often our media rely on hear say, rumour and dubious deductions to keep the story rolling on.   To think that they were interviewing people who were sticking around &quot;sight seeing&quot; while events were unfolding.   It's just sick.</p>

	<p>As far as media attention is concerned, I disagree with John, but agree with Brad.<br /><br />Putting a media muzzle on a major event that has happened for the purpose of public manipulation is NOT what a democracy does.<br />If the public are the targets of any kind of danger, they should have the right to know about so they can avoid it, and also to know WHY so they can lobby or vote for governments and policies that would prevent it happening. <br />To expect that keeping the public in the dark and hoping a schoolyard bully tactic 'ignore them and they will go away because they want attention' is a dangerously naive tactic both in itself, in what kind of other wrongs would be allowed to slip through as a result, and most importantly what kind of society it leads to.<br /><br />That aside, I DO agree with Yank that trying to discern motives so early is not a good idea either. But I must stress, maintaining an information blackout will make people do EXACTLY that.</p>

	<p>&quot;Yes, it is way to early to go into the whys and wherefores.&quot;<br /><br />Sorry to burst your ignorant balloons, JohnC and Yank. We already know much about this terrorist.<br /><br />He was an ordained Muslim cleric in Iran before seeking political asylum in Australia. He was convicted for sending derogatory letters to families of fallen Australian soldiers. Yesterday he requested an ISIS flag in exchange for the release of some hostages. <br /><br />Manny Conditsis, a lawyer who represented Monis at one point said of him: &quot;His ideology is just so strong and so powerful that it clouds his vision for common sense and objectiveness&quot;<br /><br />From The Gaurdian website: &quot;As recently as last week on a website he used both to defend and promote himself, he announced that he had converted from Shia to Sunni Islam and pledged his allegiance to the caliphate declared by the militant group Islamic State.&quot;<br /><br /></p>

	<p>Don't know if it aggravated the situation but it annoyed me. What a lot of oxygen to give a sole drongo, when they did not just cover it but kept covering it for many hours when NOTHING was happening. Once we'd been told, surely half hourly updates would have been sufficient. All it took was a few Arabic words to cause everyone to go feral. Funnily enough, at the same time, a siege in Victoria, on a domestic scale, also long term, received nothing. The word &quot;terrorism&quot; caused total overreaction. Yes, I did want to know what was happening, but truly, this was just overkill.</p>

	<p>If memory serves, certain people were quite dismissive of terrorism threats, Yank.<br /><br />They joked. They mocked. They accused the government of manipulating people's fear. The forum was thick of them and they fed off each other's righteousness.<br /><br />Now we have two dead innocents and one dead monster. If any copycats feel like following suit, they'll do it soon. It's not harmless teenagers and plastic swords any more, but crazed gunmen and fear. The &quot;trumped up&quot; threat has been proven real once again. <br /><br />The people who thought this wouldn't happen now have nothing to say. So now is the perfect time to talk about this issue.</p>

	<p>Zing,<br /><br />&quot;If memory serves, certain people were quite dismissive of terrorism threats, Yank.&quot;<br /><br />And we are likely to be much more dismissive now.<br /><br />This was not a &quot;terrorist attack&quot; in any way, shape or form. The mere fact that irresponsible social vandals are trying to use this as justification for the politically-motivated hysteria of the past few months (a cynical response to the government's flagging political fortunes), suggests even more strongly that the heightened state of alert is a simple political ploy from a government that finds itself, through it's own duplicity and incompetences, in danger of suffering complete electoral anihiliation.<br /><br />I'm old enough to remember Wally Mellish and his famous siege. Apart from the number of people involved, there are more similarities between it and yesterday's incident than between yesterday's incident and any terrorist attack I have heard of.<br /><br />Our society is full of people who feel, rightly or wrongly, that they have been done a grave injustice by society. And our society also has more than its fair share of people who are suffering from mental illness. When you combine these two factors with an hysterical campaign by news outlets, backed by a sppoked government willing to do almost anything to cling on to power, what you get is a ticking time bomb.<br /><br />We do face a threat, but it is not from terrorism. The biggest threat to our society and social harmony comes from a combination of perceived injustice, and the real injustice with which we tend to treat members of minority communities and those who don't quite fit in. When this is combined with a rise in mental illness and a saturation media and poltiical campaign designed specifically to raise levels of anxiety and xenophobia (very effective in your case), we cannot reasonably expect incidents like yesterday's tragic siege not to happen.</p>

	<p>gbe,<br /><br />&quot;The guy should not have been given asylum in the first place.&quot;<br /><br />Why not? There is no doubt that he was a genuine asylum seeker fleeing persecution in Iran. As such, Australia was obliged to provide him with a safe haven and anybody with any respect for the law would accept this. In fact, it was for cases like his that the current international (and Australian) law was designed.<br /><br />I think that the problem is that Australia has never been very good at supporting newly arrived asylum seekers who are highly likely to be suffering mental issues related to the traumatic experiences that led to their flight. But, then again, we haven't been terribly good at supporting our Defence Forces members who are traumatised by their service in defence of Australia's interests (or patching up after ANOTHER failure of Tory foreign policy) either.<br /><br />What the experience of the last 24 hours shows us is that our negligence in dealing with the mental health problems of traumatised asylum seekers and military personnel is not just callous and uncivilised, it exposes us all to unnecessary risks. We cannot afford to continue to blame the victims of mental illness. After all, we don't lock people up for catching a cold.....yet.</p>

	<p>? a cool, careful and collected response is required to prevent this incident further polarising, alienating or inciting long-established but sometimes marginalised elements of our multicultural community.?<br />What a ridiculous thing to say. Nothing that we as a community can say or do will make people who already want to kill us to hate us more or less.<br />As for the so called moderates of any community who may be targeted by such restraint, the simple fact is, that if they can be pushed towards murder and violence simply by what is said about the nature of their community or religion by people affected by these events then they were already extremists and simply hadn?t acted yet.<br />This sort of moral relativism and cowardice simply encourages those who would commit such acts because they see it as weakness and that weakness in their own minds justifies their attacks. <br />Those saying it is too early to ask why this happened are simply trying to prevent timely critical analysis because such an analysis will show that their tightly held left wing idealism breaks down in the face  of the extremes  they are trying to protect, because those extremists target this weakness in our community first.  <br /></p>

	<p>Yank,<br /><br />I agree that we should really see...like with all the media running to call the normal flag an Islamic State flag errors can be made.<br /><br />The reasonable, thinking people have to be a bit pro-active because the bigots, loons and PMs will be trying to run the other line.<br /><br />Obviously a mad, twisted loner attack, where religion has been mixed up in the psychological problems. Just like the Christian Norwegian mass murderer, Anders Behring Breivik.<br /><br />But already those with a vested interest, like Tony Abbott,  are trying to imply this was IS. He went on with his 'death cult' line even when expressing sympathy for the victims.<br /><br />It pays to be reminded not to run to aggressive bigoted responses, because that only makes it more likely to happen again.</p>

	<p>dogtags,<br /><br />&quot;we'll have days of this nonsense, strung out journalists trying to get a new angle on the story.&quot;<br /><br />I've actually started to wonder whether the whole &quot;O.B&quot; thing has been taken a little too far. I'm getting a little sick of seeing reporters standing outside court houses and hospitals relaying information that they collected before leaving the studio. Their proximity to the &quot;action&quot; provides no additional information. So why are they there? Why aren't they telling us their story from the comfort of a studio?<br /><br />Yesterday I switched on to watch &quot;Egg Heads&quot;, but was confronted instead by a reporter standing outside a coffee shop. The vision could have been recorded in front of any coffee shop. I left the tv running in the background and got about my business. For the next hour the reporter continued to provide the same commentary that was being given when I first turned the tv on. <br /><br />If anything had happened, there is no reason why news of the fresh development could have been delivered as a news flash that broke into normal programming. There was very little point in the journalist simply repeating the same information over and over again.</p>

	<p>This.<br /><br />When will the media realise that over-exposure of these types of events is playing into the hands of the extremist mindset?<br /><br />The Media would of course march out the 'people have a right to know' card.<br /><br />We won't ever know the true details or motivations of this anyway, we will only know what the media sanctions as the most appropriate way to present it that aligns with whatever agenda they are pursuing.<br /><br />Don't buy into it. Don't toil over every article, dissection and analysis of this. Accept it for what it is - tragic and unneeded - and move on. The more outrage this fuels, the worse our society will become whilst the media sit back and rub their hands in glee at the reaction they have been able to evoke and the morbid fascination that people can't resist.<br /><br />PS Terrible cost. Really sad for families involved.</p>

	<p>I do weary of all these comments that lump &quot;the media&quot; into one monolithic silo.<br /><br />It plainly is an easy cop-out. And shows real ignorance about how the news media are structured and actually operate in the information/news market.<br /><br />Firstly, there was a pluralism of media coverage from the muted and circumspect right though to the sensationalist front covers of the Daily Telegraph in Sydney.<br /><br />Of course, when a major incident such as this occurs, there must be coverage via both the usual outlets and within the more immediate and often febrile social media channels. That is the mediascape we now live in.<br /><br />I noted some pretty ordinary coverage and grasping at straws during the long wait for the situation to be resolved. But, it is impossible really to pretend this type of incident is not happening in the interests of denying this type of criminal oxygen.<br /><br />I do hope all news media outlets find time to reflect deeply on their coverage and practices during the situation: their strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />Despite the huge media machines brought to bear, there were long stretches when we, as citizens, knew very little of what was actually occurring. You can call it &quot;morbid fascination&quot; if you choose. I don't agree. But the police certainly kept much from the public gaze for a long time during the operation for apparently sound reasons.<br /><br />And, even today, there is much to be revealed and detailed. I do agree that the focus upon the criminal should be low-key and restrained. But coverage there must be. That is the kind of more open society we live in. The alternative is not an option for us.</p>

	<p>I awoke this morning and one of the first images I saw on the TV was an old news video of this idiot waving his placard saying he had been tortured in prison for writing political letters. That image gets carried around the world. There was no commentary attached to it. Why do we have such vacuous morons for journalists and news editors.. at least attach some commentary if this video is to be shown to explain that &quot;political letters&quot; was the act of sending insulting letters to families of deceased soldiers  and &quot;torture&quot; was the act of other prisoners throwing excrement at him when in prison ( for what turned out to be far too short a time) By not attaching commentary , these morons simply do the work of ISIS. If they cant understand that, they should be out looking for a new job..</p>

	<p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that we have a virus spreading rapidly through society as we know it. It is more infectious than Ebola, it is transmitted by &quot; the media&quot; and it goes straight to the brain of its victims. It has mutated into various formats and will continue to do so. Reality TV, social media, low cost sensational news items and head lines unrelated to the &quot;news&quot; article are some of it,s forms. <br />The symptoms are minds devoid of original thoughts, community leaders appearing in public to verbalise only the bleeding obvious and what were sources of news transformed into ideological commentary. It feeds on this type of tragedy and is then able to live on air for weeks even months. I fear that I have caught it by doing this, &quot;you know what I mean&quot;.</p>

	<p>Whilst I completely understand your sentiment the thing is this is a big story. 17 people taken hostage in a city cafe by a man with a gun and quite possibly other things may have been planned elsewhere. How else were people in the city in the last 24 hours going to know about this deadly incident, and how to avoid it, other than through the media?<br /><br />I must say channel 7's watermarking of the footage was truly appalling...the person who made that decision should be sacked forthwith.</p>

	<p>I disagree if it means REAL information about the conflict coming to light (background of assailant, possible motives) to prevent such things happening again. <br /><br />I do however agree that making a spectacle out of anything else around the issue should stop. It's not informative, it's merely exploitative.</p>

	<p>The moron was a criminal who had been accused of murdering his wife and engaging in violent sexual assaults on women.   Just like many criminals, he did not want to pay for his crimes.  Instead of just hiring a good lawyer, he chose to hurt more innocent people in an attempt to convert his crimes to a religious excuse.  To all the apologists who refer to 'radicalisation' I say to pull your head in, take a deep breath, and separate the man from his religion.  This was not a religious stunt, merely a desperate fool trying to make excuses.  Don't make them for him.</p>

	<p>From an ABC interview in 2001:<br /><br />&quot;He is Ayatollah Manteghi Boroujerdi, a liberal cleric who fled Iran four years ago after being very critical of the Iranian regime. Ayatollah Boroujerdi?s wife and two daughters are now under house arrest in Iran, and he?s hoping the Howard government will put pressure on the regime there to let his family join him here in Australia. &quot;<br /><br />At that time the ABC had no trouble accepting him as a cleric and referring to him as such,</p>

	<p>Bev,<br /><br />&quot;The flag was not an IS flag but he asked police for one&quot;<br /><br />I am afraid that you have fallen for th eoldest trick in the book, and you have played it on yourself.<br /><br />There was no request for an IS flag. The rumour to which you refer had its origins on a Facebook page posted by a person CLAIMING to be an escaped hostage. It later turned out to be just another case of desperate attention-seeking from someone seeking vicarious recognition. But the exposure of the hoax was ignored by the Murdoch Press, who repreated the lie verbatim.<br /><br />So, what is this &quot;oldest trick in the book&quot; that I mentioned? It is quite simple, it is the trick you play on yourself when you want to believe something so badly that you are prepared to suspend your credulity in order to believe the absurd. And you have fallen for it hook, line and sinker.</p>

	<p>Susan,<br /><br />  Without his religion, then perhaps this would have been a recourse not available to him.<br /><br />One has to ask what is the Islamic community doing about clowns like this?  I don't think it's acceptable that they just be allowed to get on with the message of hate.<br /><br />They should be shouting him down and demanding that the police do something about him.  This may be the case and if so they need to make it public so that the rest of us feel assured that they are doing the most to seperate their religion from extremism.<br /><br />Where does this rhetoric that 'religion can do no wrong' come from anyway?  Why is the problem always something else?  It's always politics, or socio-economics, or just 'That guy is a loon'.<br /><br />Why is religion never held to account?</p>

	<p>David,<br /><br />&quot;The over reaction and at times hysterical media coverage is NOT a good look.&quot;<br /><br />I'm afraid it is a little more serious than a bit of damage to our image as a supposedly civilised society.<br /><br />I think that there is a strong argument to be made in favour of turning our attention to how the hysteria of which you speak actually contributes to the likelihood of similar incidents occuring in the future.<br /><br />At the moment, our society is facing an epidemic of mental illness and personality disorders and far too many sufferers &quot;fall through the cracks&quot; into the criminal justice system. The majority of victims appear to be adolescent and young adult males and their interaction with the criminal justice system while sin a disturbed state can set up a pattern of erratic or even nihilistic behaviour that, once initiated, is almost impossible to break.<br /><br />The constant barrage of media reports suggesting an imminent terrorist threat, high profile &quot;anti-terrorist operations&quot; that yield no results (other than a plastic sword) and the conga-line of conservative politicians seeking to spin every incident to their own political advantage creates the perfect environment for the growth of delusions in a disturbed mind.<br /><br />I suggest that we should seriously consider turning our backs on any politicians or news outlets who seek to sensationalise every incident and draw links where none exist, for their own commercial or political reasons. So far I think that the response from our politicians has been measured and responsible, but I cannot say the same for our news outlets, or our &quot;security&quot; establishment, who have both sought to exploit this incident for their own purposes.<br /><br />They should realise how dangerous it can be to provide people who are delusional, with terrorism as a nucleus around which their delusions can coalesce. Their delusions will still manifest themselves in one form or another, but few of these will be anywhere as dangerous as allowing a delusional person to become convinced that they are a holy warrior on a jihad.</p>

	<p>In this instance we have a deranged man. He claimed to be an expert in black magic, astrology and numerology (and used his 'expertise' to get women alone and sexually assault them).<br /><br />Those are not the actions of a devout Muslim. The Quran condemns his actions clearly. These are the actions of a narcissist who used religious symbolism to garner media attention so he can supplement his own sense of grandeur. <br /><br />It is devastating that two innocent people have died because of his actions. It's also terrible that he attempted to hijack an entire belief system.</p>

	<p>A nutter or not this guy?s motivations were religious. He was explicit about this.  Islam like some other religions advocates violence to achieve certain ends. Let?s not whitewash the truth about this incident.  Muslim leaders in our community speaking out against terrorism is a good start to rein in fanatics like this.

	<p>In the author's attempt to dismiss the obvious - the hostage-taker was motivated by a religious ideology - he proves his ignorance:<br /><br />&quot;The banner was not the one now most commonly associated with the so-called Islamic State.&quot;<br /><br />You need to keep up with to date, John Blaxland. From the news.com.au website:<br /><br />&quot;The man inside the cafe said that if police could get him an IS flag, then he would release some hostages,&quot; said the (Musilm community)  leader.<br /><br />Possession of the IS flag is illegal in Australia. &quot;A contact I know from Counter Terrorism phoned me four or five times Monday asking if I could find them an IS flag, in a hurry. At one stage I had a team of people trying to find one,&quot; the leader said.<br /><br />After receiving the calls, the community leader rang everyone she knew.<br /><br />&quot;I must have called 50 people trying to find an IS flag. I found plenty of people who had one, but they didn?t want to give them up. They also believed that the police were trying set them up,&quot; the leader said.<br /><br />PLENTY of people had one? Does that mean plenty of people in Sydney support IS and the actions of the Martin Place terrorist?</p>

	<p>The flag used by the Saudi's, by ISIS too and by many Muslims is called shahada. It's the phrase that says 'there is not God but Allah and Mohammed is his prophet'. It is one of the five pillars of (sunni) Islam. It's not sinister. I have a wonderful, handmade one framed and hanging on my living room wall. I cold get you a one made, to your own colour palate if you like?</p>

	<p>Dove.. Your sympathies are very subtle.. Give me your address and I will send you a nicely made bit of embroidery that says &quot; Allah does not exist, there is only God and Jesus is his Messenger&quot; . Take a photo of it so I can see where abouts in your house you have placed it.<br />If both Islams and Christians could agree to display a flag that says &quot; Alllah and God are two names of the same diety&quot; then maybe the world will advance a bit. A bit of tinkering by humans with their respective holy books might be required though.<br /></p>

	<p>I don't use my religion on this site, zeus, I don't trade on it but I don't hide from it, behind it or make excuses for it either. I took shahada as an adult years ago and I am totally comfortable in displaying it in pride of place. Without boring you with my theology, Allah is just aArabic for God. Allah and God are different words for the same thing. Jesus is also a major Islamic prophet. So, please send me your ornate calligraphy and I'll get a frame for it. While your at it your might send me a Hebrew one and I can have a tryptych</p>

	<p>I disagree, Dove. The phrase is sinister. <br /><br />Why? Because from now on, people are going to associate the phrase with it's true defining image: Two terrified civilians, being forced to hold the flag at gunpoint. <br /><br />That has been the reality of many people in the Islamic world for years. And now it is ours.</p>

	<p>Why would one want a flag that suggests there is a god anyway? It is a fantasy made up by men who want to control others. Believing such nonsense is the beginning of isolating one's self from others. It in turn creates creatures like we have just witnessed. <br />Just one more thing...has anyone at all seen a muslim put a bunch of flowers outside that cafe where those poor people suffered all day and night.....unles they are dressed in western clothes...i have not seen ONE.

	<p>Whilst this idiot was just another deranged murderous criminal, and his actions have been roundly denounced by the moderate Islamic community, it is the hateful teachings of radicalised self-proclaimed Muslim clerics that continue to fuel the fires of hatred within this community. <br />And this leads so many criminals like Man Haron Monis and others to commit these horrible crimes in the name of Islam.<br />Free speech is primarily a Western value that is abused daily by these radical elements. <br />It's a value that is turned back in a violent way onto the very societies that give these people refuge from the troubles they originally fled from.<br />Until the moderate Islamic communities, loudly and publically, force these radical hate inspiring elements from their mosques, all Muslims, and their religion, will be viewed with suspicion.</p>

	<p>Craig,<br /><br />&quot;In the author's attempt to dismiss the obvious - the hostage-taker was motivated by a religious ideology - he proves his ignorance:&quot;<br /><br />Actually, it is you who have proven your ignorance.<br /><br />&quot;You need to keep up with to date, John Blaxland. From the news.com.au website:&quot;<br /><br />And where did Mr Blaxland get his &quot;scoop&quot;? That's right, he got it from Facebook - from a post by a person CLAIMING to be an escaped hostage - later exposed as a hoaxer.<br /><br />In reality, the banner displayed the Muslim equivalent of a Hail Mary. It is used by a political organisation in Syria that has no association with IS.<br /><br />&quot;Does that mean plenty of people in Sydney support IS and the actions of the Martin Place terrorist?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Plenty&quot; is a comparative term. The report you qouted claimed that the cleric called about 50 people and &quot;plenty&quot; of them had IS flags. The term &quot;pleny&quot; in this case must be seen as relative to the 50 people called so, in reality, it could be as few as five people. Now, there are around 4 million people living in Greater Sydney. 5 compared to 4,000,000 is not &quot;plenty&quot; - it is what you call a stitistically negligible number - a &quot;blip&quot; if you like.<br /><br />In truth, IS has virtually no following in Australia, and this is especially the case for Austraila's Moslem community. But it is the sort of organisation that is likely to draw in people suffering from pre-existing psychological and psychiatric disorders. And the sensational rantings of hacks like Blaxland simply make IS' job of recruiting the disaffected and deranged so much easier.</p>

	<p>John, I think you are extremely unfair on mad people. I can't see any strong evidence this bloke was mad. I can see a lot of evidence he was just plain bad. To &quot;reach out a hand of friendship to strangers who may be feeling uneasy, threatened or marginalised&quot; ain't necessarily the way to deal with people like this. In fact, our &quot;niceness&quot; is used against us by such people. And remember, this guy was marginalised as being too radical. In Iran.</p>

	<p>Indeed- by tacking &quot;Crazy&quot; as a motive is lazy and results in the following problems.<br />1- people who have mental illnesses or other abnormal mental conditions are treated as ticking timebombs (which is ironic that political correctness designed to stop particular demographics from being scapegoats for public scorn deems 'crazy people' perfect substitutes to bear the brunt instead).<br />2- Any motives, causes or drivers for this crime are ignored, ensuring the same thing happens again, and other people become victims.</p>

	<p>&quot;Yet it is important for us all as Australians to respond graciously, respectfully and lawfully, trusting that the institutions of state, the police and security authorities, are the ones to manage aberrant behaviour.&quot;<br /><br />Indeed.

	<p>I did not and do not, as you suggest or imply, advocate or condone a backlash. <br /><br />What I am saying is the Cronulla riots were a manifestation of perceived inaction by authorities, over many months, to respond appropriately to  'aberrant behaviour' by one section of the community against another, whether that was right or wrong is irrelevant here.<br /><br />The result though was a backlash against the perpetrators of that 'aberrant behaviour' by the 'wider' community. And the targets were indiscriminate, except for their appearance. <br /><br />The risks remain.</p>

	<p>The state failed us by let in this crazy person in the first instance, and by not taking stronger action against him once they became more aware of his insanity.<br /><br />The Judiciary has clearly failed the community in a dramatic fashion by allowing him to be on bail despite all that was known about him. Clearly (and to any person with common sense) his prior behaviours demonstrated he was a danger to the community.<br /><br />at least one function of the state managed to be effective as the police managed to attend to this person properly in the end.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>An interesting attempt to downplay the religious connections of the attacker.<br /><br />No mention of his being known as a religious leader, no mention of his previous history of religious harassment of the families of dead soldiers and public announcements denouncing &quot;enemies of Islam&quot;.<br /><br />Treating the public of Australia as ignorant fools will not bring about communal peace and well being.  Unilateral declarations that we are all one are pointless.<br /><br />It is up to those who reject our society and its moral values who must change, not us.<br /><br />What we must not do is allow this man's refugee status to affect our refugee policy, at least not generally.  (There may be a case for scrutiny of those who adhere to the dead man's religious and political affiliations).  There is no justification for cutting back out humanitarian aid to those fleeing persecution because one of the recipients of our good will repaid us in so evil a manner.</p>

	<p>This is a secular society, and personally I'd like it to remain so. I don't want his religious connections downplayed, I want them disregarded altogether. His religion is not against the law - his behaviour is against the law. <br />I don't think anyone should be able to validate violent, intimidating criminal behaviour by insisting that somehow their actions are bigger than their own personal choices,  or that those choices come from more spiritual motives. If we acknowledge that, we give this man a dignity that he doesnt deserve. His behaviour was craven, cowardly, misogynist, abusive. He had a history of assault. <br />And I understand it, harassing the families of dead soldiers is not just appalling bullying, it against the law as well.</p>

	<p>The lesson to be learnt is that the Islamic community needs to take a long hard look at its teachings. Why does this religion attract so many extremists around the world? It is not a religion of peace but one of jihad. I'd suggest Muslims in Australians examine their own faith and try to bring it into the 21st Century.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>The same can be said of Christian fundamentalists such as Westbro and the like, and there are just as many extremists of non-Abrahamic faiths out there.<br /><br />I think religion in general needs to be removed as a crutch to explain any form of behavior. <br /><br />This 'Sheik' (or whatever he claimed to be in Iran) was clearly unstable, and used his Sunni faith to justify his behaviors... he was not unstable because of his faith, just like Westbro followers used random excerpts of the Bible to justify similar behavior to this mad-man, minus the death... so far.</p>

	<p>Attempting to equate the odd wayward Christian congregation with Islamic extremism might help you sleep better at night but is hardly accurate Lord Erebus. Many Christians devote their lives to helping the needy based on what their 'religion' says, should we stop that as well? If people actually read the bible rather than just believing what others say about it you wouldn't make such silly comparisons.</p>

	<p>I do accept your point of view, but not all of those people in our prison system are in there for crimes of this caliber &amp; level of seriousness.<br /><br />A lot of the inmates are there for more petty scenarios.<br /><br />These are the ones who would take out retribution against the type of creeps who news stories like this are written about.</p>

	<p>keyboard,<br /><br />&quot;Definitely a Madman, he should never have been allowed out of prison&quot;<br /><br />Do you really believe that prison is the appropriate setting for the treatment of mental illness?<br /><br />By the way, I strongly resent your use of the term &quot;Madman&quot; to refer to sufferers of mental illness. Do you call people with renal failure &quot;Kidney freaks&quot;?<br /><br />Mental health is a serious issue. It is not something that should be used in the way you are using it, to score cheap political points. People who suffer from mental illness have a double burden to bear. With most illnesses, at least your brain and mind can act as allies and speed your recovery. With mental illness your mind and brain are no longer working together and, in many cases, serve to resist and hamper your recovery. And, if that isn't enough for them to bear they have to deal with self-opiniated, knowledge-free cowards attempting to turn this into some sort of &quot;law and order&quot; issue.<br /><br />All too often people suffering from mental illness end up on the wrong side of the law and are dealt with by the criminal justice system, and this is why our gaols are full of ill people whose only real crime was falling ill in a society that refuses to devote more than the most meagre resources to dealing with the mental illness that it creates.<br /><br />Yes our legal system is failing - it is failing to deal with something that it was not designed to deal with. It is society in general that is failing most completely by not devoting sufficient resources to the problem of mental illness and, in particular, identifying and dealing with the cause of the epidemic sweeping through young adult and adolescent males. And it is our news outlets, conservative politicians and the leaders of our police and intelligence services who are also failing us in attempting to play up any suggestion of terrorism for their own purposes. I doubt that they realise just what a good job they are doing on ISIS' behalf.</p>

	<p>The man was on bail for a murder charge. I'm not advocating simply &quot;revoking bail for murder charges&quot; as that is simplistic and counterproductive (think about how many falsely accused would spend time behind bars).<br /><br />However for offenders of violent crimes, something like a psyche exam should be conducted before violent offenders are put back on the streets.</p>

	<p>putting the joke aside, everyone inside is innocent, he was not on bail for murder as i understand it, he was on bail for accessory to the murder.  He was also on bail for sexual assault and indecent assault charges.  If he came up for bail and the court granted him bail, then the job has been done, of course the courts make mistakes, as do the police and prosecutors.  The prison system is groaning under the weight of people on bail, what you have to remember is that once you are on remand, you life literally goes to shit and if proven innocent you are still unlikely to just trot back into your old life as if nothing has happened.  Everytime something like this happens the public screams 'get tough on crime, lock em up', but that has been shown time and again to just not work.  What if he had gone to trail and been found innocent, and he had come off remand and gone out and done the same thing?  You are always going to get the misfits (as this bloke seems to be) or complete loonies, but you are not going to stop them by locking them up on remand for ever and ever, all you will do is push up the prison population and create a bigger bill for the public to foot and create a whole lot more 'educated' career criminals.</p>

	<p>How was it this known violent criminal with a long criminal record, not to mention a record of erratic behavior, was allowed on the streets and not in prison to begin with?  What did he do for a &quot;living&quot; when he wasn't engaging in crimes?  <br /><br />Something is very wrong with our &quot;justice&quot; system when peaceful protestors are jailed but violent nutcases are allowed to run free.</p>

	<p>Why was this person out on bail, he was a suspect in his wife's murder, had a violent history &amp; was known to police, so again it looks like our legal system has let us down once again.<br />The media coverage of this event was really nothing short of sensational rubbish, with countless repeat showings of the same scene with innate commentary from reporters.<br />The whole thing should have had blanket control to reduce the sensationalism side of things &amp; this would have deprived the gunman of the notoriety that he desperately wanted.<br />We had to expect something like this to occur after the Govt. decided to enter the Iraq situation again &amp; after this appalling TV &amp; radio saturation news coverage, we can very likely expect more of them.</p>

	<p>Very good point Nova re media coverage.<br />We, the public, were told to continue with business as usual.<br />Media, however, saw an opportunity to beat the drum of sensationalism for its own sake. <br />Most programming was cancelled - something most unusual.<br />A 2 minute, hourly update of the siege would have been ample.<br />Instead we witnessed the speculative-thought brigade, fresh from their coverage of the workplace death of a cricketer, go into over-drive.<br /><br />Has the media any feeling for the victims or, in this case, hostages and their families? Why telecast such a disaster?<br />Thank goodness the police reined them in to some degree.</p>

	<p>Though to their credit the media refused to release any of the stuff he wanted them to release (allegedly, as the Police advised them not to do so).<br /><br />A Channel 9 reporter spoke with him twice and at length but flatly refused to say on TV what was spoken about in order to not promote what he wanted the world to hear.<br /><br />It was good to see some restraint in this instance.<br /><br />And yes... the advertisers did well out of everyone watching the events so avidly.</p>

	<p>tallpaul, there is sometimes a diplomatic deadlock at work.<br /><br />Although the Declaration of Human Rights states that &quot;Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country&quot; this is sometimes impossible to achieve.<br /><br />Iran, for example, has frequently refused to accept Iranian citizens who have committed crimes overseas back into Iran.<br /><br />That leaves a country like Australia, that suffers from illegal entrants from Iran, in a terribly difficult situation if trying to return them. If the illegal entrant is rejected by the home country, then landing that person in such a country will lead to a diplomatic confrontation, possibly including the holding of the aircraft and other passengers.<br /><br />Similarly, currently living in Brisbane are two former Burmese Generals who have confessed to mass murders, but who seem safe from prosecution because Myanmar (formerly Burma) has refused to accept them back.<br /><br />Australia could make such a legal provision, but it seems that Australia could not compel the other country to abide by it.</p>

	<p>&quot;There are no lone wolfs in this game. ISIS actually commanded that individuals do exactly this. Same thing.&quot;<br /><br />I'm not sure the rest of us share your definition of 'lone wolf'. It doesn't mean someone who's come up with their jihadist ideas independently of global geopolitics. It's someone whose awareness of IS is via mainstream media, not direct contact, and who is acting relatively independently of other terrorists.<br /><br />From what we could see, this guy barely had a coherent plan. He didn't even have the flag he actually wanted to have and was clearly defensive when aware that this had been identified in the media. He didn't have explosives and if he had accomplices there's no sign they were too involved.  It's hardly ISIS's finest hour if they're claiming they were orchestrating anything. This guy was from everything we can see acting independently and thus this was a 'lone' action.<br /><br />The biggest risk to Australians remains overseas travel in countries where monitoring terrorists and preventing people making bombs etc is all at a much lower level than here.</p>

	<p>Ribald comment this is indeed. I think you should be ashamed of yourself with this shameless politicisation of such a tragic event. The ALP Hate Club knows no boundaries it seems with all this rubbish out lately, what a false flag event they say, to take the heat off Hockey and so Abbott can be a hero they say, on ALP pages. Disgusting. Take a good look at yourself please.</p>

	<p>I've read that this man was granted political asylum in Australia.  I also seem to recall a former time when immigrants or refugees accepted immigration or asylum on the basis that they would be law-abiding citizens, minor things like parking tickets aside.  This man had numerous criminal convictions.  Here's a question: why, after his first serious conviction for violence, was his asylum status not revoked, and he deported back to Iran?  Have we given away that legal avenue?</p>

	<p>Obviously, ribald, and the way his case went through the courts is a separate issue.  However, my point remains: if he &quot;breaks the contract&quot; he made when accepting asylum here, then we have the right to tear up the contract and put him back where he came from, surely.  It costs around $100K a year to house a prisoner.  Why should we fund that for someone who is only here because we offered him a safe haven from persecution?  He didn't join some peaceful protest or make his grievances, whatever they may have been, in a law-abiding way, he resorted to violence.  The first time he was convicted of that, he should have been on the next plane out of the country, I believe.</p>

	<p>The bleeding hearts won't allow a criminal to be sent back to his home country knowing it would result in death.<br /><br />Keeping him behind bars for an indefinite amount of time would seem &quot;inhumane&quot;, even when he has already done multiple accounts of heinous acts.<br /><br />So instead, like the little saints we are, we release him into to the vulnerable masses where he takes up hostages in a chocolate shop. <br /><br />All I can conclude from this is that Australia has deemed the welfare of insane and cruel outweighs the safety and lives of the innocent who contribute to society.</p>

And there's this:<br /><br />&quot;Monis ? who had more than 14,000 'likes' on social networking site Facebook - branded Australians who supported the United States and its foreign policy 'racist and terrorist' on his Facebook page, which late on Monday night was taken down.<br /><br />&quot;Shame on Team Australia and shame on those racist and terrorist Australians who support the governments of America and its allies including Australia.&quot;<br /><br />14,000 likes - now that is the scary part.</p>

	<p>On the topic, its the exact opposite. ...ISIS is urging these crazy &quot;lonewolfs' to do their dirty work for them.<br />More generally the main issue to arise from this has nothing to do with Islam. Its the fact that once again we have an individual with a long history of violence including charged with being an accessory to murder of his ex-wife, and who is still allowed to walk our streets. Magistrates and judges are the ones putting these type of people back into the community and they are the ones who need to do a lot of navel gazing and figure out what they are getting paid their high salaries for.<br /></p>

	<p>No tallpaul, Iran would probably have said &quot;good ridance to bad rubbish&quot;. <br /><br />However, he could have had his visa cancelled and been put into Immigration Detention until Iran or some other country decided to take him (or he died). Australia has enough of our own home-grown criminals to have to accept criminals from other countries as well. <br /><br />Of course idiots like Senator Sea-Patrol will bleat on about &quot;the most vulnerable people in the world&quot;, however she has identified the wrong group with this label. The most vulnerable people in the world are the two Australians that died at the hands of this foreign criminal and it is time we started looking after our own, not placating the lunatic asylum industry.<br /><br />If we can't deport foreign criminals then the next best thing to do is lock them up and throw away the key. It will certainly make refugees think twice before they decide to treat Australia and Australians with disdain.</p>

	<p>Terry, I've very glad that &quot;in Australia law abiding citizens are not allowed to have guns.&quot;  Here, a hundred or so die from gun violence each year.  In the US, where law abiding citizens are allowed to have guns, and lots of them, it's over fifteen thousand each and every year.  If you are seriously suggesting we should allow widespread ownership of guns, then I'm very, very glad you are in the minority.</p>

	<p>Although I hate to introduce the so called Cronulla riots of 2005 into this debate, the sad fact remains that after the booze fuelled stupidity and violence of fists, feet and bottle throwing (mainly directed at the cops!) erupted during the hot afternoon of December 2005, very highly organised retaliation arrived by the carload that night. People were shot at, stabbed and beaten with weapons. It is a miracle that nobody was killed that night. Windows of hundreds of vehicles, shops and homes were shot out and  smashed with baseball bats, iron bars and bricks not only in Cronulla and other parts of Sutherland Shire but in the Eastern suburb beach areas that had no link whatsoever with the so called riot. The police authorities played this down as they had failed miserably in their response measures. Quite simply they were overwhelmed by the scale of the situation that was allowed to build up. It's easy to beat down drunken hoodlums with a baton to stop them from continuing with their violence. Not so easy when the perpetrators are fuelled on hatred and quite likely have a 9mm Glock pistol, just like the one you have, pointing directly at you. Despite some window dressing after the event the main issue of why so many young men linked to the Muslim community seem to have free access to and a strong willingness to use illegal weapons has never been addressed. It remains a serious problem.</p>

	<p>This was not a terrorism act as far as i am concerned, it was more a mental health issue..and the wrong assessment by the authorities in allowing to walk among us freely .. Has anyone asked &quot;why oh why was this very unstable individal allowed to be on bail&quot;!!! ?? And how many more KNOWN cases like this one, do we have out there in our communityat this momement... ticking time bombs ???? I am very proud of how sydneyites have reacted in such frightening circumstances.. We have to be reminded that being muslim does not make you a terrorist..praise to the various religious reps that prayed together.. <br />This is the last type of person you want released , on bail. Who was responsible for granting of the bail. What a winner that one was!!So incredibly sad for the people who have lost there loved ones..</p>

	<p>It was a religious zealot and coward who used his religion in it's literal interpretation at the behest of other fundamentalist religious zealots of Islam. As to their mental health, they all think they are pretty mentally healthy and wish us to be as mentally healthy as they are. What diagnosis suits you this time ? And next time ? And the one after that ? Do people really think this is it ?

	<p>the hostage taker has a proven record of violence against women. As Minister for Women, Abbott should use this tragedy as an impetus to address and tackle domestic violence and especially violence against women as the number one national priority. unfortunately, being the opportunist that he is, abbott will only use this tragedy to stifle more of our freedoms and rights and turn australians against each other. Divide and conquer! Eventually anyone criticising the govt about anything will be deemed as &quot;identifying with the ISIS death cult&quot;.</p>

	<p>The cringe factor is alive and well in Oz.<br /><br />I find it in the puerile reporting of the fact that the siege had made it onto international newspapers and websites Really ABC? That's news? <br /><br />Its not, its a circle jerk.<br /><br />Looking for some sort of validation from the NYT or the BBC website? &quot;Look everyone, we made the news!&quot;.<br /><br />Meanwhile, this obvious criminal act is being spun as a &quot;brush with terrorism&quot; by our very own PM. What is this? Wish fulfillment?<br /><br />The power of fear pumped into us is just waiting to burst and there are plenty of power groups waiting to take advantage on both sides of the fence.<br /><br />Grow up already!<br /><br /></p>

	<p>The only thing that makes people safe is that most people have no desire to harm another.  I dont see much planning or anything difficult for the vast majority of criminal acts.  Fortunately this speaks well of 99.999% of people.  Their emotions prevent them from doing such horrible acts.  <br /><br />No matter what happens in a society, there will be some violent and crazy people.  Whilst this one man is a person I wish was never born, the vast majority of people will continue to be sympathetic to others whilst pursuing their own goals for what they deem as a better life.  <br /><br />Humans will have extremes with some being Saints and others being Satans.  Only if we paid as much attention to the Saints (not necessarily those deemed such by the Catholic church)</p>

	<p>Why was this guy still walking around free. How do we know how many young impressionable people has he influenced? I am hearing be tolerant, harmonious, be accepting of the Moslem culture &amp; Islam. Human nature dictates a fear of  what we don't understand.<br /><br />I am born &amp; bred in this country. I fear these people. I don't like the changes we are forced to endure to tolerate their beliefs. Examples of changing our celebrations of Christmas in schools, pre-schools, shopping centres among possible others, so we do not offend them.<br /><br /> We are a Christian society &amp; tolerant. Is it our tolerance, that assists in creating these personalities? Is it our tolerance that they see as weakness, that the proportion can preach their radical ways &amp; beliefs. I say to all of them if you can't accept our way of life &amp; behave accordingly go home. <br /><br />I don't want to hear this gross act was carried out by a single individual. How many others may have influenced in a similar way? No guarantees</p>

	<p>Full of excuses and avoidance, John Blaxland.<br /><br />Your allegation &quot; ... our multicultural community ...&quot; is a falsehood. We do not have a multi-cultural community - we have a mono-cultural community, and that culture is Australian. <br /><br />And you say: &quot;But the incident echoes the sentiment expressed by its leader Al Baghdadi, who has called for such acts of violence against non-believers&quot;.<br /><br />Of course it does, because total Islamisation is the aim. Hamas is involved in a programme aiming not only at the elimination of the state of Israel but also at the destruction of Western civilisation itself. In a speech given on October 2011, its leader Mahmoud Al-Zahhar stated that ?This Western civilization (sic) will not be able to withstand the great and glorious Islam.? <br /><br />And in Islamabad, the mufti of Bosnia, Mustafa Ceric, urged Muslims ?to conquer the world through the holy word movement.?<br /><br />And you go on: &quot;To be sure, there are parts of the Koran that refer to unspeakable acts of barbarity against non-Muslims&quot;.  And you attempt to justify this by: &quot;But there are also many parts of the holy texts of other religions that are downright brutal as well - not the least of which is the Old Testament in the Bible&quot;. But you fail to show where in the Bible, or the Torah, or in any of the other multitude of religious texts, it is proclaimed that immediate entrance to Paradise is guaranteed to any person who slays an non- believing infidel.<br /><br />And never forget or try to hide the truth of the fact that this murderous individual was granted entry to and support from Australia after claiming to be a refugee.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p><br />A chilling reminder of just how dangerous one man can be. Look back at Awale Mohamed shot in Riverwood in 2004. Would Man Haron Monis have still done this if he received suitable mental health support?</p>

	<p>&quot;Following the Sydney siege, we must avoid defaulting to the view that any criminal act that includes a garbled interpretation of the Islamic message is part of a planned, pre-meditated and co-ordinated attack.&quot;<br /><br />I think I agree. This guy reminds me of Guy Anderson (Luke Batty's father) who was so arrogantly fixated on his own power and desires, it clouded his judgement to other people's point of view. One-man fundamentalist wrecking balls both. People like that will tend to use whatever excuse is handy at the time to keep on top. So, the Muslim flag was likely just a convenient prop in the Lindt Cafe siege.<br /><br />But as Greg Bartion has already said, IS will still try to claim credit. A good thing about the coverage of the siege is that everyone around the world can see what's going to happen in lone-wolf attacks. You can't possibly succeed, as it won't be allowed to happen.</p>

	<p>This wasn't some loner (Martin Bryant style), this incredibly dangerous man was highly visual to the authorities. <br />Billions of dollars are spent every year with the aim to protect Australian citizens.

This is not 20-20 hindsight but sheer commonsense.<br />He had posted extreme views on a website. Chained himself in the city to protest. Written letters to people. Charged as an accessorry to setting his wife on fire and being investigated for sexual assault.

	<p>He was just an unstable man with access to a gun, it really doesn't matter what message he was trying to spout at the end to justify his actions, because he would have done something similar no matter the reasons. He could have been claiming he was the reincarnation of Attila the Hun and was trying to recreate the terror he caused in his past life and the outcome would be no different. He certainly was not &quot;a networked holy warrior&quot; though, if he was other actions would have been coordinated to coincide with the mother of all distractions taking hostages in the middle of Sydney right across from a building full of journalists and reporters could have been (using &quot;could&quot; because so far it seems that there was no other event).</p>

	<p>The scale of the incident was an existential one, not because of what Man Haron Monis did, but because of the standard reaction to it. Even when he forced the hostages to hold up a Muslim flag the official statement was that the authorities did not know what the motivation behind the attack was. This kind of incident will remain an existential threat and in fact can only be an existential threat while those leading our society refuse to acknowledge what is really going on let alone confront what is really going. Determining whether Man Haron Monis was primarily motivated by Islam is less important than eliminating our &quot;leaders&quot; kneejerk &quot;No Islam to see here, move along&quot; reaction that occurs every time something like this happens. Man Haron Monis' religious beliefs and opinions were an element of this and it is idiotic to pretend otherwise.</p>

	<p>Our first real local example (apart from an incident with Turkish terrorists in Broken Hill in 1925) of why faithist doctrines need to be revised or removed from public domain as anything but historical curiosities and as examples of how psycho-social development goes wrong when people follow a doctrine in which a god-character endorses negative behaviours and attitudes towards non-believers for any reason.<br /><br />The multifaith 'solidarity' shown by faith leaders during the incident just adds insult to the injury suffered by the victims. <br /><br />Pragmatic 'polite' and academic society apparently regards that various kinds of Judeo-Christian doctrines and the tomes in which they are delivered are 'sacred' and necessary for 'community cohesion'. Some don't care about the beliefs themselves but think that other people should have them in order to be stable and happy. That that perspective is shown to be ridiculous at times such as this but the perspective is retained indicates the intellectual shallowness and inhumanity of those holding it. <br /><br />The fact is that there are extremely negative, clear and unambiguous statements in such doctrines about unbelievers, anyone opposing (including criticising) the faith type endorsed by the doctrine, and about motivations for holy war of various kinds (and many metaphors for the same).<br /><br />I did not see any of the 'marginal' faithist 'leaders' or Islamic 'leaders' offering to negotiate with the Islamic faithist murderer - who was following a mode of behaviour painfully familiar from proponents of his faith worldwide throughout history. The 'Islamic' leaders in the community should have done no less than knock on the cafe door and put themselves in the firing line to stop the faithopath gunman.<br /><br />Judeo-Christian Faithist conceptions of community, unity, and fulfilment are necessarily secured with a doctrine that requires them to be partisan, exclusivist, and to treat unbelievers, heretics, other-faith faithists, and heretics in an ultimately negative and derogatory manner. Salvation doctrines and creeds do not lessen this one bit - nor do they lessen the insult to the unbeliever. <br /><br />I don't want to be truly accepted by you and your faithist buddies on the condition that I believe in the same fairy tale that you do  - rather than believe that it seems to be patent mythical nonsense. Even if you think it is really really real, which makes it more apparent to me that there is something really wrong with you. What an arrogant position faithism embodies - and how narcissistic and egotistical it is. Join us in belief or be demonised, but some imaginary character loves you. Really? Grow up.<br /><br />Faithists say people are  okay with them and their god monsters so long as we believe what they do and change our entire personal disposition and political and ideological orientation to match their conservative indoctrinated one. The love of Allah? The love of Jesus? Who CARES wh</p>

	<p>How many of these 'lone wolves' do we have to put up with? and what is the common denominator in these cases.<br /><br />Do you read the papers? I do and everyday we have stories of so called refugees being charged with violent crimes. Us Aussies in the suburbs are fed up with the broken down assessment processes of the immigration department and judiciary, ably assisted by the do gooders such as the greens and triggs. This is why Abbott is taking a hammering in the polls, and hopefully the conservatives will wake up.</p>

	<p>One of the things that has kept popping up in this comments section is a question about why the man had not been deported. And the answer to that is: he hadn't yet been found guilty of anything that warranted deportation.<br /><br />Yes, he had sent insulting, disgusting and threatening letters to the families of dead servicemen, however that alone is not grounds for deportation, no matter how much we think it is.<br /><br />In regards to deportation, what matters most are the violent crimes he may have committed, i.e. being an accessory to his wife's murder and having a history of violence against women. The problem here is that these cases had not yet gone to court and as such, no concrete legal action could be taken against him.<br /><br />It was in this legal limbo that he entered into this tragic siege, with the goal of publicity and (though this is pure speculation) suicide by cop.<br /><br />The bottom line in all of this is that we didn't yet have the power to deport him due to the legal system we have, and therefore he still had all the rights of an Australian citizen, including the right to apply for bail.</p>

	<p>The siege in Sydney had to end somehow. It is regrettable that 2 others died and some were injured and traumatised.<br /><br />Man Haron Monis was nothing but a moron with a shocking criminal record. How could a  judge/magsitrate grant bail to a person with such a violent record?<br /><br />History shows the Monis tried radical moves against authority  in his home country, we gave him asylum and this is what we got in return.<br /><br />He  got what he deserved, and has saved the public purse thousands by not having to keep him in ail. <br /><br />Well done and thanks must go to all enforcement who risked lives to save hostages and rid another radical monster from our midst</p>

	<p>We need to face some harsh and unpleasant realities. Multiculturalism often does not make Australia a better place. These types of terrorist incidents will NEVER be stopped without a long-term solution. <br /><br />The largest political party in the Netherlands according to the latest polls ,the PVV is calling for stopping all muslim migration, the closure of mosques, banning of the Koran (as Hitler?s Mein Kampf is banned) and financial encouragement for Muslims to move to another country. <br /><br />It would be better for all concerned if some groups in Australia followed their faith in more accommodating nations. Australians could then feel much safer from this type of terrorist attack. This is a humane long-term solution to this problem.<br /></p>

	<p>&quot;Now is not the time for shrill or emotive reactions.&quot;<br /><br />And your's isn't?!!<br /><br />Nothing like pretending that your viewpoint is that of someone with a &quot;cool, careful and collected response&quot;, by declaring anything that doesn't align with what your article concludes is the &quot;right&quot; response, must by definition be automatically &quot;shrill or emotive&quot;!<br /><br />I; like many, many Australians are becoming more and more inured to the bleatings of those who just love to represent themselves, as you are here, as the embodiment of how we - as Australians, ought to think and respond to the actions of those who clearly have no concern (even disdain) for a Nation whose equanimous foundations are based upon purely christian values.<br /><br />And whether I believe in the christian faith or not; I am able to recognise the danger to be had in being so 'Christian', even as an Aussie Muslim, or an Australian atheist or antipodean agnostic, or great southern land cali-bloody-thumpian that one turns the other cheek so often, that one doesn't have a cheek to turn anymore because both cheeks have been slapped right off.<br /><br />Who cares whether the cheek has been slapped by willy, thoughtful planners with conspiratorial agendas underpinning their motives of destruction; or loony tune individuals who are merely acting out their own deranged plans of revenge upon those they see as beneath them?!! <br /><br />The bottom line is they are ALL members of a faith that was not essential in the creation of the morality or society that we appreciate so naturally in this country that we are even prepared to allow individuals who take that morality and society so much for granted that we allow them to write articles like the one you've written here.  <br /><br />Articles that indeed attempt to embarrass those individuals who would prefer to defend the morality and society that so many generations of Australians have toiled long and hard to create, into acquiescing to those who'd rather get shafted, rather than show some guts for once in their lives.<br /><br />Comprehending reality and accepting it, despite it's implications to the supposed 'values' we hold as individuals, does not make someone who does so &quot;shrill or emotive&quot;, except in the reckoning of those who think themselves &quot;strong&quot; by hanging onto their naivety until it's way too late.</p>

	<p>Having read both the article and many of the comments, I am encouraged. Free speech and individual thought, regardless of the content us still occurring!!!! This is what all peoples must strive to keep, our Right to Free Speech.<br />The horrendous events of the past 24/7 is not acceptable; as a society we need to be vigilant. This in so many areas highlighted,eg Domestic Violence, inappropriate detention of criminals (non Australia citizens), actions of the media. Here I must say, our prime minister was utilising the media highlighting the &quot;potential for political motivated terrorism&quot; ( please feel free to correct). He too has the Right to free speech(albeit somewhat disconcerting). <br />The role of the police Response Team (RT),unit also needs to be afforded greater scrutiny, and indeed feedback to Australians accordingly. When viewing the YouTube actions of the RT, appear discordinated, firing through an open door (???), stun grenades being thrown at random (one officer I observed took quite some time to dislodge his/hers stun grenade and just through same over the heads of his/her colleagues. This does appear to be inappropriate professional actions of an elite operative force. This was called &quot;Pioneer&quot; ect. Too, the random gunfire. The TRAGIC loss of life that ensued. Will the Australian public be informed as to who was responsible for the deaths of the innocent people's, along with the perpetrator of this personal and national event?????? <br />I do question as to why our elite military were not involved???, mahhap they were???<br /><br />To the victims, all, who will have been marked by this horrendous event, their beloved families, indeed to the families of a beautiful young women, mother, sister, Aunty, wife, as too for the handsome young son,brother,uncle and partner(both who's lives have been snuffed out, all too early,this for the taking of a beverage, and working for a company that offers people's a job, a cup of coffee), words at this point will have no great meaning, please all that is sincerely stated herein, the survivors, families of lost loved ones, do know that the peoples of Australia grieve with you.<br /><br />Pauline R.

	<p>&quot;That view would be confirmed were there to be, say, a fascist banner or the demands of a resentful estranged parent rather than a Muslim banner on display in the shop window.&quot;<br /><br />On the contrary, we condemn as a whole anyone who subscribes to the beliefs &amp; teachings of Fascism and if a person uses that symbology whilst committing a crime we use that as affirmation for our condemnation of anyone calling themself a fascist.<br /><br />Likewise, were an estranged father to take multiple hostages in order to lash out against his ex-wife/partner this would be used as affirmation for movements opposing violence against women &amp; sexism in our society.<br /><br />So why is it a special case when it's Islam? Why is the media and left falling over themselves to assure the community at large that a muslim man practising the muslim faith who takes a hostages while espousing Islamic ideals and forcing hostages to hold up an Islamic flag has *nothing* to do with Islam?</p>

	<p>'my worry is that abbott will now use this as an opportunity to call in an emergency session of parliament before christmas and introduce even more draconian laws that will stifle even more of our rights and freedoms.' Haven't noticed any changes in my life due to these 'draconian laws', and I am sure that the vast majority of the country have felt absolutely nil effect as well. If you've suffered under these new restrictions, there's generally a reason and if not, it's still worthwhile inconveniencing the occasional innocent person for the sake of community security. <br /><br />By the way, where now are the delusionists who have screamed loud and long that the terrorist threat is just a ploy by the government to deflect attention from the budget - if they are honest,they will know that when they look in the mirror today  they are  looking at a fool.</p>

	<p>This man was on bail with several charges against him according to ABC news reports. He had also been charged with being an accessory to the murder of his wife.and while he wants to be identified as some sort of &quot;holy warrior&quot; (flag etc) he also seems to have the characteristics of a criminal with mental issues.<br /><br />So it looks a bit like 'surfing&quot; the terrorist agenda but not really being part of it; playing to their theatre but acting similarly to other criminal hostage takers.</p>

	<p>It is very concerning that the Islamic community does not see the problems within their ranks.<br />They would like us to see this terrorist as a lone wolf, isolated case of a deranged nutter.<br />What about 100+ who went to IS to kill innocent, are these also the isolated cases??<br />They must have a look at themselves and start addressing the issues rather than pretending that all is somebodies else fault.</p>

	<p>In taking a firearm with him the gunman premeditated violence. That is criminal.<br /><br />Taking a flag with him, that was then displayed in the cafe window for the world to see, was also premeditated. <br /><br />Whether this incident was a terrorist act motivated by the ISIS movement or not, the gunman's own actions have related his motives to his religion.</p>

	<p>Australian police should never have attempted to storm the building. Instead, they should have utilised foreign help (the British SAS, French GIGN or the German GSG 9) which are capable and trained to deal with situtaions like this. <br /><br />Australian police is simply not skilled and professional to handle a case like this.</p>

	<p>The problem is religion. If this guy had been a teenager who'd been found to have been playing Grand Theft Auto or listening to death metal then the media would be blaming those influences as both pernicious and culpable. So, following a misogynistic, science-denying religion with violent Jihad as its central philosophy should not be regarded as relevant when a grown man actually references it then kills people?<br /><br />Sure, he was a violent, narcissistic criminal, but his inspiration for venting his sense of injustice came from a holy book - the kind of book we're told forms a sound basis for the education of many of our children.<br /><br />The time has come to stop 'respecting' religious ideas invented hundreds of years ago by barbarians - Islam, Judaism and Christianity - and start ridiculing the religious ideas that only recently seem to have become newly respectable. The idea that people choose to believe such ridiculous things should be challenged in our schools, universities and all public institutions.<br /><br />There is no place for the supernatural in the real lives of humans and no need to defend the 'peacefulness' of stupid ideas. They're not peace-loving and never have been. Surely the evidence is in: what has history taught us if not this very simple, very obvious and very evidence-drenched thing?</p>

	<p>I'm sorry but this article is not helpful.  It would have been better to say nothing than to try unsuccessfully to say it was not a religious or political act.<br />There are extreme sects in most religions but the extreme Islamist seems far more likely to take indiscriminate action.<br />Extreme Islam is dangerous to this country and its continued existence in form we now know it.  The individuals concerned are prepared to take our sympathy and support in the form of asylum and social support, and abuse our western sense of tolerance while working towards the overthrow of our way of life.<br />The questions of this individual's membership of some group or other are not relevant.  The actual ideology and a shared cause are the uniting factors allowing an individual to feel connected and empowered with out actually being enrolled in a group - forma or otherwise.<br />There is little point in espousing tolerance, acceptance and multiculturalism (what ever that actually is) when the people we are trying to embrace actually despise our efforts as weakness and are themselves intolerant of all who do not believe in their extreme interpretation of life the universe and everything. <br /></p>
