       As we consider this shocking, unsettling, and ultimately violent act, let us choose to respond calmly. <span class="source">(702 ABC Sydney: John Donegan)</span>

  <p><strong><em>After the Sydney siege, the most powerful response to this attack on our values and way of life does not lie with tactical assault groups, security agencies or even our politicians - it lies within all of us, writes Tim Mayfield.</em></strong></p><p>The unimaginable yet inevitable has occurred with a high profile terrorist attack occurring in Australia.</p><p>Three people are dead and four injured as a result of the insane actions of Iranian cleric Man Haron Monis at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in Martin Place in Sydney.</p><p>The reality is that even though our national leaders have warned us that this moment would arrive, nothing can fully cushion the blow to our national psyche.</p><p>It is now up to each and every one of us to take responsibility for ensuring that this incident does not become a catalyst for panic and overreaction or an excuse to turn on each other.</p><p>There is already evidence that, far from dividing us, this attack is bringing us together in a rare and unique way. More so than any national sporting victory or high ranking in a quality of living index, the events of the last 24 hours have the potential to reinforce all that is good about our society.</p><p>While our political leaders cannot prepare us psychologically for a terrorist act such as this, they can and have led the way in terms of the quality of their response. NSW Premier Mike Baird and NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione have demonstrated outstanding leadership as the siege unfolded and culminated in the early hours of this morning.</p><p>There will inevitably be forensic examination of this event, including whether or not it could have been avoided. Regardless of the outcome of this post-mortem, the reality is that our governments and their security branches cannot stop every madman with a weapon, flag and hostile intent.</p><p>It can pre-empt, it can mitigate and it can respond but it cannot always prevent in this age of the lone-wolf operator.</p><p>Likewise, the Government cannot dictate our collective response to this assault on our common humanity.</p><p>So as we consider this shocking, unsettling, and ultimately violent act, let us choose to respond calmly, with confidence and with peace in our hearts.</p><p>This does not mean that we shouldn't feel anxious or angry or fearful. Rather, we can choose how to externalise these feelings - replacing anxiety with openness, fear with tolerance and anger with mateship.</p><p>In particular, let all of us in word and deed ensure that Australia's Islamic community knows that they are an important and welcome component of our national identity.</p><p>This is already occurring through the viral Twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23illridewithyou&amp;src=typd" target="_self" title="">#illridewithyou</a> in which people have been offering to accompany anyone feeling unsafe in public as a result of their Islamic attire.</p><p>It is a good start but it will take more than Twitter to reassure Australia's Islamic community that we are united with them.</p><div class="inline-content quote right">
<blockquote class="pullquote">

</div><p> </p><p>Let all of us, in our own way, explain to Australia's Muslims that we know that this not their fault and nor is their religion the reason for the violence perpetrated at the Lindt Café. Indeed, extremist Islam and the violence carried out in its name are symptomatic of larger, seismic forces. These forces - present throughout the Islamic world and especially the Middle East - include political repression, emotional and physical dislocation, economic malaise and seemingly endless conflict - echoing across generations and in all corners of the globe, including Australia.</p><p>This is not to be an apologist for the terrorists or the beliefs that they use to justify their abhorrent tactics.</p><p>Rather, we must understand and acknowledge that the Islamic community is as rich and diverse as any other religious grouping in this country. Furthermore, the twisted and distorted interpretation of this proud faith practised by men such as Man Haron Monis is but a vehicle for their pre-formed millenarian designs.</p><p>In nearly all instances, the marginalisation and hatred came first with the bastardised, quasi-religious overlay a mere justification for their violent intent.</p><p>The most powerful response to this attack on our values and way of life does not lie with tactical assault groups, security agencies or even our politicians. Rather, it lies within all of us.</p><p>As we mourn for the victims of this attack and their families, let us ensure that December 15 comes to be known as the day that Australia was changed for the better. The day that we chose to demonstrate to the world, and especially those that would seek to do us harm, that we are a confident, positive, outward looking people who refuse to be turned against each other in the face of adversity.</p><p>This is the best way to honour the victims of the Sydney siege.</p><p><em>Tim Mayfield is a freelance writer who has previously worked at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence.

	<p>Look, when a few hundred Muslims rioted in Sydney...shrieking that all us Infidels should be beheaded if we insult the prophet there was NO condemnation from anybody at Imam Central that that was a disgrace. There was NO-ONE publicly denouncing those jerks for calling on US to be killed if we insult the prophet. Every Muslim agrees with this proposition.<br /><br />Now, if any normal person said &quot;I dislike Christians because they believe in sky fairies and imaginary friends&quot; (ie blasphemed against God and Jesus) and then a few hundred Christian nutters rampaged through Sydney calling on those blasphemers to be killed, I'd expect various Ministers to condemn them. Why did no Muslim condemn the &quot;fringe crazoies&quot;. Hmmmm?<br /><br />Facts are as follow....refute them if you can....The ABC and many others are calling this Muslim killer a &quot;self-styled&quot; cleric, whilst the reality is that he was an ACTUAL cleric in Iran......not a &quot;self-styled&quot; one...and the ABC knows this. David Rutledge interviewed him( under his previous name) in 2001...on ABC Radio...<br /><br />&quot;He is Ayatollah Manteghi Boroujerdi, a liberal cleric who fled Iran four years ago after being very critical of the Iranian regime. Ayatollah Boroujerdi?s wife and two daughters are now under house arrest in Iran, and he?s hoping the Howard government will put pressure on the regime there to let his family join him here in Australia.<br /><br />David Rutledge spoke to him this week.<br /><br />David Rutledge: Ayatollah, can you tell me how long have you been resident in Australia?<br /><br />Manteghi Boroujerdi: I have been in Australia more than four years.<br /><br />David Rutledge: And why did you leave Iran?&quot; Etc<br /><br />Note that the ABC had no trouble with the AYATOLLAH being &quot;self-styled&quot; back then. This whole exercise in deception is clear.<br /><br />It's as if the Catholic Church and it's supporters started describing paedophile priests as &quot;self-styled&quot; priests. Cover up perhaps?Ddenial of the reality much? An attempt to distance themselves from their shameful( and all-too-typical?) behaviour, maybe?<br /><br /></p>

	<p>You've completely missed the point that he recently converted from shiite (when he was an Iranian cleric and using the name Ayatollah) to sunnii. He had personally rejected all the background you're describing. If he'd been like that, and as you describe, he might have been noisy and he might have been controversial but he certainly wouldn't have been asking for an ISIS flag.<br /><br />Would you have accused Northern Irish protestants of being IRA members? Because pretending Iranian shiites are ISIS supporters in Australia is pretty much doing the same thing.</p>

	<p>Mantaray I think you raise some very legitimate concerns. I, like many I imagine, have just wept at the revealed identities of the innocent people who have been killed and the knowledge of all of those now facing profound grief and loss.<br /><br />However, it does appear to me that you are implying that this is somehow representative of mainstream Islam. It is not anymore representative of mainstream Islam than the actions of the Italian mafia are representative of Catholicism or for that matter the activities of the IRA. To suggest that they are is absurd. Please try to keep some perspective and refrain from globalising this one incident of a truly horrible person across the entire Islamic faith.<br /><br />Perhaps it would help you to remember that his ex-wife (presumably a Muslim herself) faced an excruciating death and that he had been allegedly engaged in brutal sexual assaults. <br /><br />Looking at the data on the rapes and murders of women the incidence seems to cross cultures and religions. Such men also engage in brutality to others in the community. Is that religious zeal or is it just extreme personal narcissism, including religious narcissism that encourages this wild egomania.</p>

	<p>Not to mention the fact he was similarly accepted as a real Islamic preacher here in Australia by the Islamic community.<br /><br />Even after all the criminal activities he undertook he still had their support.<br /><br />Followers of Islam need to take a long hard look in the mirror and think about how their personal beliefs are encouraging others and enabling idiots like Ayatollah Manteghi Boroujerdi to justify their beliefs and actions.<br /><br />Perhaps if everyone said .... &quot;oh hang on, Islam [or insert religion of your choice] is actually really stupid ...why am I encouraging others to join and believe this crud&quot; we'd have less of these problems on planet Earth.<br /><br />ps. yes, all we hear is &quot;oh I can understand why young men would follow jihad but it is hard to understand why a 40 would do this&quot;, &quot;he wasn't a real Islamic preacher&quot;, &quot;just a lone wolf motived by something but we will never know what motivated him&quot; etc.</p>

	<p>JoeBloggs,<br /><br />You are incorrect. The hostagetaker was rejected by the local muslim community a number of years ago, and remains a congregation of one.<br /><br />If you read more of the media reports and statements from authorities you might have a clearer view of the facts.</p>

	<p>Indeed, this so-called &quot;lone wolf&quot; has apparently been a radical agitator since 2001 in Australia. He has been mentioned in ABC news and comment articles as Sheik Haron. Rachel Kahn even wrote a warning in 2008 about his activities of setting up prayer halls in which radical sermons were delivered.<br /><br />He was also apparently subjected to &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; quite recently. He was awaiting trial for accomplice to murder but was on bail.<br /><br />Yet just wait and see, as Abbott races to Sydney to try to capitalize on this tragedy politically, the response will be more attacks on general liberty of all Australians, when the failure is not insufficient powers of the police, but something far more basic.</p>

	<p>Mantaray...<br /><br />...The standard, three part response to this sort of incident from the &quot;liberal media&quot; is as follows:<br /><br />1) Distance Islam from the incident....self-styled, lone-wolf, misinterpretation of the Quran and Hadiths, recent convert...not a REAL Moslem etc.<br /><br />2) Insist that Moslems are the real victims....The story is not about Islamist Terrorism...it is about Islamophobia and Hijab wearing women fearing being heckled on the train. WE are the racists who must recant and amend our ways.<br /><br />3) It is all our fault...if only we didn't have diplomatic relations with Israel, if only we didn't contribute to the military campaign against IS, if only we welcomed all and sundry who jump onto leaky boats in Indonesia...<br /><br /><br /></p>

Same goes for where ever suburb/ community your are living. Just be a little bit more sensitive what you say, the words you chose.

	<p>Generalise much? ALL Muslims are different.<br /><br />However, the religion, to me, is repulsive not because of this clown in the cafe, but because it represents an institutionalised misogyny. How do Lefties say that Australian men are misogynists and then support things like Sharia Law. Do some reading. These are facts, not opinion. For example, a woman's testimony has half the weight of that of a man. Women are not to receive a formal education. Honour killings. I understand that it may have some &quot;peaceful&quot; ideals etc, but the subjugation of women is a deal breaker for me. Maybe I am misinterpreting treatment of women under Islam, but what I do know, is that I would be horrified if my daughter married a Muslim man who followed Islam.<br /><br />Besides, I have never understood why Muslims want to put themselves through living in the West. I would not live in a Muslim country and lecture them about misogyny. I mean, considering what I want for my daughter, life would be hell knowing that the chances are she will end up as some man's property. I say each to their own. If you love Islam, go to an Islamic country. Why that Mufti who thinks women showing any skin are &quot;like meat&quot; (I cannot recall his exact words) came to live in Australia I do not know.<br /><br />It is akin to me going to live in a Scandinavian country and bleating on about freedom and lower taxes blah, blah, blah. Why would someone like me want to go there? I wouldn't. The World would be a far more harmonious place if people thought a bit longer about their own values and those of their potential destination countries. Call me shallow or whatever, but I could only ever live in the West. I could try to move to China and agitate for democracy but wouldn't that just cause mischief? I could try to move to Saudi Arabia and call for civil liberties but I would only end up in prison.<br /><br />From what I read on here, I honestly think many readers would be happier in a place like Sweden. They should go there. I do not mean that in a bad way, it is just that any change will be at the margins. You will never experience their model of socialism in Australia. But we are free and people can continue to argue (in vain) for 60 odd percent percent taxes etc, but the bottom line is it won't happen.<br /><br />But why would Muslims want to come to Australia where (despite Gillard's assertions) women are treated equally to men. Where women are allowed to wear short skirts in public. Where women cannot be forced into arranged marriages etc. Where gambling is legal. Where drinking is legal. It doesn't make sense to me.<br /><br />Of course, I have no problem with those born in an Islamic country coming here should they not believe in Islamic teachings and therefore respect our values.<br /></p>

	<p>People keep saying it: &quot;Islam is a religion of peace;&quot; &quot;This has nothing to do with Islam.&quot; Saying it doesn't all the time doesn't make it true.<br /><br />I know lots of Muslims. My neighbours are Muslims, the guy who serves me coffee is Muslim, one third of the kids in my class are Muslim - their parents are lovely people. I don't know any Muslims that I don't like. <br /><br />It is possible to hold two things in your head at the same time: the vast majority of Muslims are good people, but there is a problem with Islam. Read the Quran. Read the Hadith - it is quite simply a lie that Islam does not justify, condone or encourage violence. It does, and events in Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan and Kenya and Nigeria and London, America, Bali and Beslan and Spain and China and, and and....are testament to this fact.<br /><br />The many Muslim communities need to own this fact. I don't need them apologise for the madmen. I don't need them to justify their faith. I don't need them to feel any sort of personal responsibility. I want them to start reforming their faith. They have to do it, not us.<br /><br />Until they start I will no longer believe they have Australia's best interests at heart. I'm more inclined to believe the man who serves me coffee: &quot;My cousins are mad, you can't reason with them - they love what is happening in Iraq and Syria.&quot;</p>

	<p>The real question is not whether the Quran offers any justifications of violence but whether it does moreso, or more convincingly than the other Abrahamic religions. It doesn't. Their ideas are all roughly equivalent and they're all an affront to commonly held Western values like neo-liberalism, liberalism, atheism, pluralism, and humanism.<br /><br />What do you mean when you say you want someone to reform hir faith? Your calls for what you don't want are all clear enough but I don't quite understand what you would like to happen or how it can be achieved.<br /><br />So, it seems that the calls to &quot;reform your faith&quot; are simply part of the refrain to the chorus of &quot;x is a religion of peace.&quot;<br /><br />Whether or not repeating something makes it true may be beside the point when a repetitive dialogue fails to stimulate progress.<br /></p>

	<p>@ Melena Santorum, what you have said is simply false. <br /><br />There is a vast difference between Islam and Christianity that is fundamental to the nature of the faith.<br /><br />The Quarn states that all non believers are apostates and Allah demands that they be killed or converted. <br /><br />The Christian God offers salvation to all who would take it and requires nothing from those who want salvation other than a desire to receive it<br /><br />Yes the old testament has similar passages to the Quran in dealing with non believers, however the Quarn does not have an equivalent to the New Testament, which tempers those directions with the notions of forgiveness and acceptance,  in fact it has exactly the opposite with hundreds of years of Islamic scholars indoctrinating their followers to believe the Quarn is the literal word of Allah and that there is no room for negotiation in the interpretation.<br /><br />Until Muslims want to change Islam it will continue to be used to justify terrible actions. This is not to say that all Muslims condone those actions or that other religions to not have fanatics, but failing to see the inherent risk that the Quran represents will not change the fact that the risk exists.<br /></p>

	<p>I am afraid the fundamental issue is faith.<br /><br />Once a person resorts to a single instance of faith based thinking, then there is no stopping further incursions.<br /><br />Eventually you get to the place where plenty of people are at which is once life's hard questions get too hard, just pass them over to faith.<br /><br />If there is a god (considered improbable amongst evidence based thinkers) it gave us rational thought. We are supposed to take the time to think it through. We are supposed to develop ourselves to higher planes of thought as we mature. If not, we would not have the brains we do. We would have the brains of monkeys or dolphins instead.<br /><br />The thing we are not supposed to do with our god given brains is use primary school level thinking abilities and be stuck in fictional texts written for iron age peasants.<br /><br />The problem is not Islam or Christianity, its faith based thinking.</p>

	<p>It simply cannot be argued that, world-wide - the Islamic communities are obviously not placing enough emphasis on moral issues such as not killing.<br /><br />This is a bsic requirement for the continuation, let alone the advance, of civil society.<br /><br />That it is not receiving sufficient emphasis in the education of followers of Islam is evident.<br /><br />As you correctly state, the same nonsense which exists in the Koran also exists in the holy books of other religions.  But somehow the followers of those other religions seem to have embraced a more modern and realisitc approach to life's issues than have the followers of Islam.</p>

	<p>Firstly, I'm an atheist. Secondly, their ideas are not roughly all equivalent, they're just not, and please don't quote Leviticus at me (the Old Testament is also an important Holy book for Muslims). Please don't go on about Kony (a Christian Animist), or the IRA (terrorists who happened to be Catholic, but were not informed or motivated or justified by their Catholicism), don't mention Hitler or the Crusades.<br /><br />If you want to put me in my place about Christianity, quote something in the New Testament to me that goes anywhere near what is written in the Quran and is held to be the literal word of God.<br /><br />One of these people had a sword he called the &quot;Cleaver of Spines:&quot; Jesus Christ or the other bloke.<br /><br />None of that matters. We are here talking about Islamic inspired violence.<br /><br />And by reform, they need to have both an internal and public discussion about what their Holy books say in much the same way as the Catholic church is now discussing the celibacy of its clergy, about how the Christian churches routinely and openly discuss their ratbaggery (homosexuality, abortion, women in the clergy et cetera).<br /><br />The lie just doesn't wash anymore. Own it.<br /></p>

	<p>The Christian sects (all 38,000 of them) of the Abrahamic faith have been through a process of being reformed.<br /><br />Which is why Christians simply ignore the vast majority of the teachings found in the bible and go about their secular lives in very secular ways (with the exception of popping into church now and then and giving the CCF a few dollars to hedge their bets in case Yahweh/god/allah etc is real).<br /><br />Heck the Vatican (the most staunch of all Christian sect leaderships) constantly reforms its doctrines and teachings.... it was only last year that they stated that Aliens from other planets will be welcomed into the Catholic faith and can be baptised as &quot;we are all gods creations&quot;....which is a dramatic statement considering Genesis makes no mention of Aliens being created by the Canaanite deity Yahweh.<br /><br />The reality is the entire story relating to the Yahweh character has been in a state of constant change, he went from being just one of 60+ demi gods (children of El &amp; Asherah) to the 'one and only' god of Islamic/Hebrew/Christian mythology.<br /><br />As such the Islamic faith can (and should) reform and change, it is out of date and people are dying because of the reluctance of the Islamic leadership to reform their version of the Yahweh mythology.</p>

	<p>Christianity did it at the time of the reformation.  Before that it was just as violent as Islam.  No it's not complete there are still extreme elements but overall a real difference.  I will believe a Islam is a religion of peace when and if  that reformation occurs.</p>

	<p>Meredith,<br /><br />&quot;You could equally say that the bible encourages violence and mayhem with some of it's words.&quot;.<br /><br />Could and have (and will continue to do so). Many of us consider all religions to be dangerous and harmful (and/or just plain ridiculous) and criticise them as such.<br /><br />Some religions seem more prone to mutation and violent mis-interpretation than others.</p>

	<p>Meredith: tell us where Jesus called his followers to kill unbelievers, or to strike the necks (behead) of those who disagreed with them?<br /><br />The witness of the new testament was that the followers of jesus died for their faith, not killed for it. <br /><br />some have justified killing in the name of jesus but look at the bible and their justifications don't stack up. <br /><br />those who kill in the name of Islam can readily find backing for it in their sacred texts</p>

	<p>Peter S,<br /><br />I wholeheartedly agree with everything you say.<br /><br />I have known and worked with dozens (maybe hundreds) of Muslims (mostly kids) and, almost without exception they come across as fantastic, caring, hard working, good humoured people who have treated me with respect and courtesy (as I have treated them).<br /><br />But when I think about what they have been told/taught to think and what they REALLY believe about us and our permissive, progressive (by comparison) society, as opposed to the friendly persona they present, I know that, if they are true to their faith, they don't respect our (many and varied) beliefs, our freedoms and (fast fading) egalitarianism. Not at all. It's far more contempt than respect. And I wonder how many of them are being told/taught to sympathise with, or justify to some extent, the sort of atrocities that are becoming more common.<br /><br />I once picked up a Koran in a library and thought I better have a look to see what all the fuss was about. I opened it to a random page and started reading. I could not bring myself to finish that one page (yes, I know, what an ignorant xenophobe I am) because it was absolutely riddled with calls to brutal violence against infidels. It was truly disgusting stuff (wish I took note of the page number).<br /><br />If Muslims see nothing wrong with their religion - and I would contend that many/most do not, given that they don't see &quot;Islam&quot; the religion as playing any part in these atrocities (what a joke), and they consider the koran and the prophet mohammed as being beyond criticism (perfect even) - then they will see no reason to change. And they won't...it's the other 5.5 billion of us who are just plain wrong remember (and, depending on who you talk to, should all be killed).<br /><br />And so we will go round and round in a cycle of atrocity and (insufficient) recrimination. While some families lives are ruined by nutty religious ideology. I can see no real solutions in the life time of anyone alive today. So sad (hope I'm wrong though).</p>

	<p>I'm not &quot;off the leash&quot; but I do have some valid questions that I think Australians have a right to answers.<br />1.	The NSW judiciary has to tell us why this murderer was on bail considering his record and his recent style.  In my opinion, on current information, the NSW judiciary has to answer for the deaths of the two innocents.  I suspect that this murderer was given bail for political correctness reasons (he claimed he was tortured when previously locked up) but I will stand corrected.  <br />2.	This murderer was given political asylum in the early noughties by the Howard Government which was, in hindsight, a huge mistake.  What is in place now to stop these mentally deranged from coming to Australia?<br />3.	Which ABC Breakfast show will have the most Muslim apologists on this morning out of Radio National and NEWS24 Breakfast?   Ellen has had 7 and I lost count with NEWS 24. I?m still backing Ellen.<br />4.	At what point are our pathetic politicians going to stop bending over to the Muslim leaders and demand that the Muslim community themselves co-operate fully by outing these radicals and not protecting them because they are Muslims.  Until the free, democratic and peace loving Muslims do this in their hearts, they will never become &quot;Australians&quot; in the way every other ethnic and religious group has in time.</p>

	<p>Duncan<br /><br />I disagree.  He was not &quot;outed&quot; by the Muslim community, prior to this tragedy.  <br /><br />During the ABC/Muslim apologist agenda this morning, everyone interviewed condemned the murderer with a &quot;but&quot; and a removal of the Muslim leadership from any responsibility.  None were asked by the ABC any of the tough questions like, if they had known that he was a danger (or had a gun) to the community, would they have gone to the Police and reported him.<br /><br />More importantly I am listening now to the Deputy Police Commissioner ducking the &quot;bail&quot; issue.  This is the critical issue that should be justified promptly by the relevant Judge/Magistrate.</p>

	<p>Interesting points -<br /><br />1. I agree, clearly whoever the magistrate or judge was who let this person, with a known history of anti-social violence, out on bail deserves to be disciplined for that.<br /><br />2. The wisdom of hindsight ism't much help.<br /><br />3. That is as inflammatory as ISIL using the internet to create these incidents.<br /><br />4. I agree however this must also be extended to the Christian leaders doing the same with some of our local &quot;pastors&quot; who preach similar views against Islam. Or even simpler just ban religions of all sorts unless they adopt simple anodyne philosophies that only preach tolerance.</p>

	<p>Sorry, GA, but you ARE off the leash.<br /><br />The issue here is whether this man was a fundamentalist who happened to be crazy, or a crazy man who happened to be a fundamentalist. If we take fundamentalism out of the equation, we find an issue that people like Patrick McGorry have been talking about for a long time now- that being the dilapidated state of mental care resources.<br /><br />If there had been access to better and more specialised mental health facilities, would this man have been on bail? I suspect not. I agree with your assessment that his faith was likely used as part of his defence, but I suspect also that his mental state was the likely reason he remained in the community. The argument probably ran more along the lines 'further incarceration in prison will damage this man's mental state', to which there was undoubtedly expert psychiatric support. Without access to appropriate resources to facilitate holding this man until his day in court, he was released as the 'lesser evil'.<br /><br />The truth is that this is a demonstration of the failure of the social compact, the degradation of the safety net. The economic arguments that drove the reduction in dedicated mental health resources were all from the perspective of the cost to the state of housing and supporting those who have only limited capacity to cope with life. There was never a measure of how that safety net serves EVERYONE ELSE, by giving these people somewhere to be other than in the community that does not understand them, that often shuns them, and which they come to distrust and resent.<br /><br />This is the consequence of the economic rationalist argument of 'user pays' that leads to bash-the-unemployed, bash-the-mentally disabled, bash-the-(insert low income earning subtype here) rhetoric that is used to justify the ongoing reduction in social support services. The wealthy can generally afford to pay for their own services and/or the means to distance themselves from the consequences. The poor don't count. But the middle class? I can't afford to 'distance' myself.<br /> <br />If I wanted to see life from a purely selfish perspective, I could state that I see the reduction in support to those who need it most as the removal of an insurance policy that protects me and all of my ilk from those less fortunate by removing the risk that they will see me as a soft target. If that's the argument in this me-me-me society that will see a shift in attitude towards the provision of that safety net, then maybe we should promote the argument in that way.

	<p>Good point, David.<br />One thing that commentators can tend to forget is that we have large numbers of people living in Australia who have lived through violence in other countries.<br />If you know anyone who migrated from Ireland in the 1970s, or from various former Yugoslav Republics, or from some South American countries, or from South Africa/the Middle East/Southeast Asia, then you know people who have lived through the fear of deadly violence every day -- these people know how to sum up the various &quot;religious&quot; or political claims of the perpetrators of violence. And they know that blaming and taking sides can cause problems to escalate.<br /></p>

	<p>When the Drum posts a commentary that labels him an &quot;Iranian cleric&quot; we probably do need lessons on not going off the leash. Was he an Iranian or an Australian? And who exactly ordained him as a cleric? <br /><br />It is very easy to plant subtle messages in reader's mind - sometimes messages that the writer does not even deliberately mean to plant.</p>

	<p>One of his lawyers confirmed this morning, on various radio stations, that he was an Iranian cleric that had obtained political asylum (through the generosity and kindness of the Australian people), therefore he would be an Australian, assuming he was naturalised.  It worked out really well for the two murdered this morning , didn't it?<br /><br />Alternately, a professor from Melbourne also stated, this morning on the ABC, that he was not an ordained cleric, but an impostor, although he had never met him.</p>

	<p>My understanding is that he was an official Ayatollah in Iran who worked for the Iranian theocratic government in some capacity before being accepted into Australia as a refugee (for being &quot;too liberal&quot; for Iran!) and then bringing his wife (who he is later suspected of murdering) over. Those are the details I have read so far, if they are wrong feel free to correct them.</p>

	<p>Members of the Australian Defence League are walking the streets too harassing and intimidating Muslim women and girls. Until an act of violence is committed these people can be spoken to by police but otherwise they are entitled to the freedoms that we all enjoy including  freedom of association and religion.<br />A loony like Haron Monis is free also till an offence is committed. That is what differentiates Australia from nations like North Korea, China and other non democratic Asian, South American and African nations,  and Russia and the more fundamental Islamic nations.<br /><br />What's your solution? Incarcerate without trial anyone who is suspected will commit a crime? How would you judge this? Round up known leaders of groups that have opposing views or values to us or have form and history? Where do you propose it stop? Who would be on your list? All the target groups that the Coalition has been attacking over the years?<br />Isn't this just the point that Tim Mayfield is making. Being better than that is the greatest non lethal weapon we can use as individuals.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /></p>

	<p>I can't see any fear mongering going on. It is &quot;backwards&quot;, but sometimes backwards is right - backwards is not by definition wrong, even if it is something that you might be personally uncomfortable with. It is just a direction. Life was never 'sposed to be a nice linear progression in a single direction. Sometimes we take a wrong turn in our eagerness to progress. We should be mature enough to recognise when we have progressed to far in a direction in error. Today might be one of those days we think about such things.</p>

	<p>hairy; I agree with you, retrospection is definitely useful and can be progressive. Today could be the day that we ask ourselves whether violence is worth it at all, withdraw our troops and retrain our defence force as learned ambassadors for seeking and sharing understanding. <br />We could call  out deadly force for what it is, the murder of some ones family member.<br /> We could also clear out our prisons and courts  of drug  offences and put these people on programs that help them break their habits. Giving more time to consider and develop strategies to help dangerous psychopaths would be an excellent outcome.</p>

	<p>G'day Foolking.<br /><br />Sadly, there are many people with drug issues who are quite dangerous to innocent bystanders.  Not only is society safer when such dangerous people are jailed, but the addicts themselves are also safer.  You wouldn't want society to have to protect itself by harsher means would you?  In the protected environment of jail, dangerous addicts at least have some opportunity to overcome their addictions.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Cobber</p>

	<p>We live in hope in respect to this issue but the reality is that criminals are given way too much leeway. Their rights seem to outweigh the rights of their victims and society as a whole. I lay the blame for that on the lawyers representing criminals who hunt up the loopholes and so called mitigating circumstances to get their customers out onto the street, the judges for believing the lawyers' crap and our legislators for failing to enact legislation that closes the door to loopholes.</p>

	<p>I believe that the police are trying to resolve all situations like this without anyone getting injured or killed. This is why they have negotiators. When something changes, when they have cause to believe that the perpetrator might harm their hostages, they go in. Other wise they're usually happy to wait things out. As they should. Sometimes to police wait too long, sometimes they go in too early. For mine, I guess we have to leave it up to their call. They do this for a a living</p>

	<p>Whazups ill informed comment demonstrates his complete lack of knowledge of police proceedures.  A police sniper will not attempt to shoot through a plate glass window, striking the glass will distort or shatter the bullet and deflect its trajectory making it a hazard to hostages and enrage the perpetrator. To the best of my knowledge the perpetrator did not expose himself outside the building therefore the snipers would not engage him. I would suggest the whazup has seen too many hollywood movies.</p>

	<p>Which is why the FBI HRT operates pairs of shooters- one to take the glass, one to take the target.<br /><br />Be that as it may, I suspect the reason they didn't take the target is because they were concerned he had an explosive device connected to a dead-man switch.</p>

	<p>... and what if there was more than one gunman.<br />... what if there was a bomb.<br />... what if the glass caused enough deflection that the bullet didn't take out the target.<br /><br />It's easy to sit back after the events and take time to analyse them but in real time occurrances things are not always so clear. Believe it or not response teams actually have solid procedures on how to deal with scenarios, they don't just make it up as they go along and the primary concern of them all is to preserve life.<br /><br />The 'Hollywood solution' is rarely a realistic option.</p>

	<p>He may have been visible through the  thick plate glass shopfront at times  .<br />That doesn't mean its safe to shot him , as despite what happens in movies or the video games you like playing, shooting through is difficult and dangerous for the hostages , the thick glass can deflect the bullet , if the  madman wasn't taken down he could have shot all the hostages . Also for a while the a concern that he had explosives in his backpack or vest/jacket , if a bullet had hit explosives again all the hostages could have died</p>

	<p>i agree. They could have taken him out as the yanks say with one shot. I heard an expert on terrorism say the words &quot;kill shot' and suggest they waited far too long. There is not reason to treat these individuals with kid gloves. There were terrified people in there waiting to die. For heaven's sake they should have shot him in the head through that window....now there are two innocents dead and others more traumatised than if they had acted earlier. I think the muslim cleric who was saying he did not recognise him or he would have gone in to talk to him...was really telling a bit of a fib..I am sure he would have known who he was. I am not usually so dogmatic but I am losing patience with those that say they are peaceful and would not hurt others but do nothing about it...the muslim leaders should preach against these atrocities every single day. And....as I watched the people laying flowers outside the cafe today....i noticed not one muslim...unless they are dressed in western clothes?? But so far, no women in their coverings or mean in their particular attire...it would be nice to see at least one of them there. No wonder people dislike their attitudes sometimes. <br /></p>

	<p>it wasn't just the PM. My office got a letter which said <br /><br />We convey our heartfelt sympathies to the families of the two who lost their lives as with all of the survivors who emerged from yesterday's ordeal.<br /><br />and my reaction was to offer sympathies to the family of the hostage taker. They lost a son / brother / dad / uncle.  I believe we was found guilty with helping to kill his ex wife, so I didn't say husband.<br /><br />so lets not use this to do another 'lets bash the PM' <br /><br />3 people died, 3 families will be in mourning.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

But mistakes are made.<br /><br />Without fresh evidence, this has nothing to do with terrorism or Islam.  If some anglo with connections to the anti-immigration movement, out on bail for murdering his wife, goes postal no one is going to say that it was a white supremacist terrorist act.<br /><br />Although Abbott was reasonably restrained he still managed a bit of dog whistling and when he said we &quot;live in a free and open society...blah, blah, blah&quot; it made me choke on my vomit.<br /><br />Australian values are now:<br />Confected team australia fascism (if you are classified as a leaner you are evicted from the tribe)<br />Indefinite internment without trial<br />Internet snooping<br />Jumping in to go kill people in far away lands for no good reason<br /><br /></p>

	<p>This is a tragic and sad event for everybody concerned.<br />Is it &quot;a high profile terrorist attack occurring in Australia&quot;?-- I have been watching the media coverage of the siege. Although this is one possible interpretation of what happened, I think we need to hear more before we can be certain of the motives of the attack.<br />If this is the work of a misguided and ill person, we can deal with our reactions in a more appropriate way than assuming a politico-religious motive.<br />The family law court bombings and the Hilton bombing spring to mind as similar events or series of events that have taken place in Australia, and attempts to fit them into a simplistic terrorist/political mould did not stand up to scrutiny.<br /></p>

	<p>Professor I think that the channels for the suggestion of terrorism were open and it was discussed around the world but nothing I saw said that it was the case, I thought the media hype was controlled reasonably well. It was as if the media were aware of their responsibility to not provoke racism.</p>

	<p>Every week, police in this country shoot offenders armed with no more than a kitchen knife.<br /><br />It was obvious from the start that this offender's intention was murder, mass murder. Police marksmen had numerous chances to take out this gun man through the window of the caf? before he killed anyone.<br /><br />But our police decided to wait until he actually started killing hostages before they acted.<br /><br />I would hate to be a hostage depending on our police to rescue me.</p>

	<p>I agree with you and I think this is the problem with Tim's article. I can't really see that this has much to do with islam at all, although I am hardly islam's biggest fan.<br /><br />Australia doesn't have a muslim problem per se. It has a psychopath problem. Or rather, we (or more correctly, our courts) seem to have forgotten how to manage these people.</p>

	<p>The fact remains that the gunman was a refugee and a muslim who given his history, should never have been at large.  The legal system and the processes for selecting refugees have much to blame for allowing people like this to roam our streets. <br /><br />This is now the first lone wolf attack by those inspired by IS.  Fortunately the police in cooperation with the muslim community have been successful to preventing others. It is also very fortunate we have such a tight control over guns.  <br /><br />Unfortunately there will be more attacks because we have in our midst people who are opposed to everything our way of life represents.</p>

	<p>Flag or not, this is the desperate act of a deranged and confused man.  We look for too many patterns amongst the behavior of the unwell.<br />Some will make flags before they throw life away.<br />Some will play video games<br />Some will listen to love songs.<br /><br />It doesn't matter what they do or believe before the violence.  Those things didn't lead to or cause the violence.  Disfunction did!<br /><br />Over the last year we've seen many such acts without a Muslim banner.  <br />A male nurse who set fire to an elderly care faculty killing many.<br />People murdered with fists in the CBDs of our cities.<br />Children killed by their parents.<br /><br />No special response is required based on race or religion.  We simply need to reject violence, stick together, support the traumatized and move on.<br /></p>

	<p>Its an emotional time for our nation, but the following line can't go un-mentioned  &quot;In nearly all instances, the marginalisation and hatred came first with the bastardised, quasi-religious overlay a mere justification for their violent intent.&quot;  Are you saying people are marginalised because of their faith, or they flock to this faith because they are marginalised?  <br /><br />I for one am deeply grateful that in this instance it does appear to be a simple lunatic instead of a genuine terrorist attack (semantics to some I guess).  But the faith referenced is, without question, a flag of convenience flown by those who just want to see the world burn.  Pretending it is not so does nobody any good.</p>

	<p>I am shocked and appalled that we keep saying a terrorist act.  This man if the media is correct was a sick individual with a misogynist agenda and a hatred of common decency.  Brutalising such a person in prison would not have helped but merely confirmed his hatred of the west and its double standards.  <br /><br />I am also appalled that the siege ended in a gun battle killing two innocent ppl.  He was a man on his own sooner or later he would have had to sleep, you cannot keep going on adrenalin.  Could we not have held off for longer.   Though I do not know if he became a danger to the hostages and a decision was then taken to go in.  <br /><br />The other point I would like to make is how many sieges that have not involved Muslims have taken place recently resulting in many deaths.  This was a hostage situation not dissimilar to them but we carp on about this because the person was a deranged Muslim as apposed to a deranged husband ect. <br /><br />For heavens sake there is another siege in Melbourne this morning are we giving that 24 hour news coverage and are we now going to hate  and persecute all the perpetrators of such crimes.<br /><br />I fear this will be another excuse to fear and hate  others because they are different please please think about what you will do while also respecting the grief family and friends will now be enduring with the loss of all these lives.</p>

	<p>I'll ride with you: If you'll remember that the police only took action 'after' he had already killed one hostage. He was already irrational, he was just getting more tired and more irritable and the safety of the remaining hostages was getting increasingly less.<br />Also, if you listent to the NSW Police Commisioner, he is calling it a criminal act, not a terrorist act. ISIS will claim it anyway, even though it wasn't an ISIS/L flag.</p>

	<p>And yet he wanted so much to make sure the public knew it was linked with ISIS that he agreed to let a hostage free if he was provided with a proper ISIS flag. How much more obvious does it need to be before you will see the writing on the wall. <br /><br />Added to that, the person who was tasked with trying to obtain an ISIS flag stated that many admitted to having one but were too scared to provide it as they believed they were being set up. This flag is banned in Australia so why do these people run the risk of ownership unless they support the violence being done in the name of Islam over in Syria.</p>

	<p>The Islamic community representatives (conspiracy theorists) that Q&amp;A gave a platform to several months ago described the possibility of this happening as just theatre!  <br /><br />Islamaphobia was the real problem they said. The behaviour of individuals was not the responsibility of the wider muslim community they said.<br /><br />Muslims blaming everyone but themselves do nothing to foster the support of the wider Australian community.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>I'm sorry, but I think that this was a terrorist attack.  As soon as someone becomes violent whilst brandishing a flag for a cause, we are dealing with a terrorist action.  That is not to say that it wasn't also a criminal act.  The two are not mutually exclusive.  The thing is that it was this man's faith that was the background to this crime.  In a world where members of that faith have for years carried out no end of despicable crimes in the name of their religion, I think it must be said that all such acts are terrorist acts, designed to hurt the whole community and not just a select few.</p>

	<p>if he were a rightwing christian american who did this in the name of Jesus, you'd find that any justification he came up with from the bible was completely at odds with reading the book in context or the witness and example of jesus and the disciples.<br /><br />If you looked to the koran and the example of mohommed or his immediate followers with respect to violence towards unbelievers, you'd find it far harder to say that violence isn't endorsed or encouraged.<br /></p>

	<p>What an appalling tragedy. And let's just stop with the juxtaposition of  random,insane and lone-wolf as useful descriptors to this lethal violence. It is far too simplistic and seeks to assimilate an event such as this to a fatal car crash. It clearly is not an accident. Whilst appearing insane and random to a rational person the logistics, resourcing and planning at some level must have been evident to persons other than just the perpetrator. The fact that this individual was well known to the police suggests that individuals who display violent intent and radicalised opinions need early intervention before being given any opportunity to act upon their crazed ideologies. Yes, it is time to heal. But it's time to get much tougher on this specific issue that continues to confront us all.</p>

If you kick a hornet's nest (the Middle East), you're gonna get stung.

	<p>Stop playing semantics with the word 'terrorist'.  To be a terrorist you do not have to carry a membership card to a specific club. This man walked into a cafe with a gun and held people hostage making them hold up a sign saying there was only the one god called Allah... I'm sure these people were terrified.  Having learnt the history of this person, most people will make the connection with ISIS calling for lonewolf action to show support to their cause. ..Its not rocket science.</p>

	<p>The best way is for us to increase our scrutiny of those who detest our society and wish to harm us.  There is no point in the bulk of the community pretending that there are not some who live among us but do not want to be one with us.<br /><br />Of course, some members of our community who are closer to the attacker in religious and political belief can assist more, by providing information on those they know are capable and willing to carry out such acts.<br /><br />A mass march, similar to those carried out in past to object against cartoons and books and other perceived slights, would be a positive declaration that these members of the community disavow the separation that leads to such crimes and wish to become full members of our society.  A huge turnout should result: the strength of feeling would be reflected in the numbers.<br /><br />After that a group hug and singing of &quot;Kumbaya&quot; would be appropriate.</p>

	<p>Terry, can I assume that you haven't marched in protest against the kidnapping and murder of Australians in domestic sieges in recent times? After all, you are of the same nationality, race, religion, ethnicity and language group as the perpetrators. <br /><br />Turkish Australians, Indonesians, Malaysians, Egyptians and Pakistanis don't actually feel much affinity with someone from Iran with his own history of domestic violence. He comes from a different nationality, race, ethnicity and language group. The fact that they have the same religion means more to you than it does to them. Islam is not a homogenous block. Your sentiments might make some kind of sense looking into Islam, but make absolutely none from the inside looking out</p>

	<p>I'm going to be blunt- because this pathetic article does quite the opposite of honouring the victims. To be fair, articles such as these are at face value responsible things to write (don't panic, don't retaliate, be nice to everyone).<br /><br />At the same time, it's disappointing that we are still left in the dark about the nature of this attack (including motivations, and more background information on the perpetrator), and are simply asked by the article to stay there, and instead accept ridiculous and disproven explanations for terrorism as good enough reasons now (being poor makes people into Islamist terrorists, despite the significant number of such extremists coming from well-to-do backgrounds).<br /><br />This vile creature had a motive and certainly a lot more background information to judge how we could prevent this disaster in future- and the decent thing to do both for the victims and for the public is to either admit you don't know what these motives were, or tell us truthfully if you do- to merely insert an assumption is an insult to us all.</p>

The investigation into the HOW, let alone the whys and wherefores of this horrible act, is in its most preliminary stages.<br /><br />And yet an opinion article has to give us a full explanation of why, what and how, or we're being kept in the dark.

	<p>&quot;The unimaginable yet inevitable has occurred with a high profile terrorist attack occurring in Australia.&quot;<br /><br />Was it really a high profile terrorist attack? If so, I think we set the bar a little low for what we consider to be &quot;high profile&quot;. It certainly wasn't high impact! I think yesterday's events are still well overshadowed by things like the bombing of the Hilton, in terms of both carnage and political significance. <br /><br />Is it really unimaginable or inevitable?<br /><br />Well, I think those phrases are both a poor choice because they seem to imply that this event was the first of it's kind. It's not. As suggested earlier, there have been other incidents of terrorism in Australia and certainly many other situations with gunmen and hostages.<br /><br />So, hardly unimaginable. <br /><br />Furthermore, some people may choose to see such events as &quot;inevitable&quot; but I am not one of them! These events are not inevitable and I doubt many people think that our collective response has no effect on their occurrence. If it's really inevitable then why bother writing about it or thinking anything about the appropriate collective response?<br /><br />I am not particularly interested in attributing any special significance to 'December 15' and would be wary of those eager to, whilst also eager to hear their rationale for why that particular day should loom large in our collective memory.<br /><br />When I saw my Muslim neighbour this morning, there was no discernible difference in our exchange of friendly greetings. I just hope that this warm amiability is not hampered by the broader cultural and political response.</p>

	<p>&quot;Was it really a high profile terrorist attack?&quot;<br /><br />Of course not.  Nothing is just itself anymore.  All weapons (even slingshots) are now &quot;high powered&quot;, anyone who's name is mentioned is &quot;high profile&quot;, any expert quoted is a &quot;leading _____&quot;, any group quoted is a &quot;peak body&quot; any act of the slightest violence (eg cyber trolling) is &quot;horrific&quot;, anything slightly unexpected is &quot;shocking&quot;.<br /><br />Soon we'll need qualifiers for the qualifiers, adjectives for adjectives &quot;super horrible&quot;, &quot;mighty shocking&quot;...</p>

	<h3 class="">Peter the Lawyer:</h3>
	<p class="date">16 Dec 2014 10:59:35am</p>
	<p>Melena<br /><br />As a right-wing lawyer, I have to say that there is a lot of sense in what you say.<br />I work in the CBD, just outside the exclsuion zone.  yesterday was a very straange day in the City.  Because the authorities had no knowledge of what was going on they went overboard.  The Media likewise. Shops as far away as the QVB shut early, as everyone just seemed to go into a daze and use it as an excuse to stop work for the day. <br /><br />Government Offices as far away as Central (over a mile from the siege) were closed. <br /><br />It was almost as if people were egging the thing on to be greater than it was. People were everywhere on the streets either on their way homewards or just walking about aimlessly. <br /><br />And because it was all a major overreaction (one that I suppose had to occur given the circumstances), I suspect we in Sydney are bound to feel strange today. SOme will want to beat up the siege into something more than it was, whilst others will go on about imagined backlashes against Muslims. <br /><br /></p>

	<p>Terry, no one is saying you can't comment on contentious issues.  However, any discussion on issues such as you mention will, sooner or later, have a commentor who parachutes in and says, &quot;I've never seen (issue) happening, how can it be as big a problem as you claim it is?&quot;.  The commentor is not a part of the group who primarily suffers from the problem; they are usually part of the group perceived to be causing the problem.  Often they firmly believe in the perpetuation of the injustice, and are deliberately trying to sidetrack the discussion or upset the participants; trolls.<br /><br />White males &quot;of a certain age&quot;, as the dominant power group in Western society, are relatively unlikely to suffer from issues such as racism, poverty, religious discrimination or sexism (particularly if they are also straight and cisgendered).  <br /><br />So men of your demographic, commenting on such issues, are often seen as patronising, minimising the lived experience of people who suffer real social injustice, clueless at best and disingenuous trolls at worst.  <br /><br />I do not know you, and I'm not suggesting you do this.  But minority groups in general take it for granted these people will appear in any discussion, and have a hair trigger about slapping down anyone they suspect of trollery.  Sometimes they misjudge. <br /><br />The best remedy is to listen more than you talk, and ask questions if you are not clear about what people mean.</p>

	<p>Its good to see all the new anti-terror laws working. A man who is well known to police, is known to have extremist views, is facing multiple charges of indecent assault and whom apparently has nothing to lose is able to get bail, get hold of a gun and hold multiple people hostage in the center of Sydney. <br /><br />Mr Abbott should repeal his anti-terror laws as the past 24 hours have demonstrated that they offer little protection at significant cost. If a man such as this is able to commit an act of terror, then almost anyone can. We need to hope that we never get an Anders Brevik in Australia - somebody who puts careful planning into an attack. Had this been such a person, then we probably would have seen 50 or 60 deaths and had their been a team of people involved, then you'd be counting in the hundreds. Fortunately for us, the likes of Brevik are a rare breed. Most criminals are of limited intelligence - much like our political masters. <br /><br /></p>

	<p>You are right!!! The authorities can't watch that many people. They don't even seem to be able to watch a known extremist. <br /><br />Further still, the law books already list multiple crimes with which such an offender could be charged. Crimes that would see him bundled off to prison for an extended period.<br /></p>

	<p>hidi, thank you once again for demonstrating how confused your thinking is.<br /><br />Tell me how &quot;dealing out punishment&quot; stops crime. Where is your evidence for that claim?<br /><br />You comment about authorities watching &quot;thousands of Muslims ...&quot;.<br />Are you aware that there are many people, not just Muslims, who may commit &quot;an act of atrocity at any time&quot;.<br /><br />Some people may even find your post &quot;an atrocity&quot;.</p>

	<p>I think your trying to down play the fact this guy was an Islamic extremist. I can not recall a religious inspired tragedy of this nature in Australia before. The chap was a Muslim  and by all accounts claimed elegance to Islamic state. <br /><br />It has been reported on the ABC there a numbers of Muslims in Australia now going  to war in Iraq to Kill for Islamic state if you follow the news you would know that. <br /><br />At some stage these killers will return so I have to agree with Hidi.</p>

	<p>Why can't we just accept this man was, in fact, a muslim? He claimed to be a muslim so to say that this man is not a muslim that is totally wrong. But in saying that, we should acknowledge that it is a tiny minority of Muslims committing or sympathizing with these offences, while the majority of Muslims will inevitably feel the backlash against something they did not do, which is unfair. But to smooth over the cracks with a thick layer of political correctness won't fix the problem; the fact remains that this particular interpretation of Islam is motivating sane and insane individuals to commit acts of terror.</p>

	<p>Daniel:&quot;the fact remains that this particular interpretation of Islam..&quot;'not a terror act is bizarre&quot; Because a dangerous loony comes from an Islam background and can drape his psychopathic ways in an Islam flag only magnifies the point that we are all responsible for our own actions.

	<p>The language we use is very important psychologically: 'age of the lone wolf' is seductive to those susceptible to their violent inner chaos.  'Quasi-religious' should be 'pseudo-', but this last is a fine point likely to be missed by those I'm talking about, especially as they'r unlikely to read the drum.  Nevertheless, it is an important distinction for the rest of us to make, as it might colour our views of Muslims in general.  Tim says what needs saying often.</p>

	<p>BTW, his Facebook page had over 14,000 likes before it was shut down. So to all those saying it's not a terrorist attack, just an attempted mass murder by some whacko madman, I must say he is a very influential madman. But more likely there a lot of Muslims, even in Australia who sympathize with his actions, ao to claim it has nothing to do with Islam, no political motivations, not a terror attack is simply bizarre. A terrorist attack does not depend on large number of people being killed, it simply needs to incite terror for a political purpose.</p>

	<p><br /> Good point Daniel. This attempt to disconnect the islam religion/political organisation from people such as the Martin Place gunman who has heeded violent texts of the islamic belief, is disingenuous, misleading and dangerous. It inhibits the appropriate response to the frequent aggressive actions and wars incited by religious adherents. <br />There would be no 'extremists' without the 'moderate' religious platform. Believing in such concepts as a man flying to heaven on a white horse (or rising from the dead) is extreme nonsense.</p>

	<p>I realise this is controversial.....but I find religion of any denomination can create...without wanting to...radicals, especially if one is prone to a mental unbalance of some sort. We see it in many many cases.....you just have to hear some of the utterings ...god told me to do it...it is in the name of god...etc it goes on. The idea of a god and all it involves can be a dangerous concept. We should be celebrating our world here on earth and the education should be about nature and decency to others without involving some fantasy figure, whichever one it is. After all, it is all made up....fantasy stories to make people feel happy and live in a dream world...very self-serving. Why not look after the innocent animals, take care of the planet, and stop inventing these ridiculous childish faith-based cults. After all, blind faith which these religions rely on to keep their congregations...is just that...BLIND..to the reality and facts of the REAL world. I think that way we will all live more harmoniously and I think in the main..have much happier, balanced lives.  And really....the leaders in the muslim community...albeit they have condemned this atrocity...should speak out much more loudly and STRONGLY..and I do not think they have done that very well. I would say the same about the child abuse in the catholic and other religious institutions...they have never, until they are forced....come out in their churches and other places they inhabit...STRONGLY against this evil crime. It is never the main focus and for the sake of everyone it should be. I am talking about every religion. It should be included in every sermon in some way, until the message gets through. The naivity of these congregations never ceases to horrify me and this is a huge part of the problems we are facing today.</p>

	<p>Whilst I don't disagree with most of your article. I do disagree with elevating it to the level of a terrorist act. This was purely an act by a demented person hell bent on death by cop.<br /><br />Whilst I do feel for those who were lost this should not be elevated to an on-going commemoration similar to ANZAC Day. Which is what you allude to Tim. It was a criminal act by a criminal.</p>

	<p>OMG: Is Tim real or some computer modelling? A day when we all came together? I don't think so, this guy struck me as more than a bit crazy, but that is all it takes. It will inspire other muslims to carry out attacks; so now the ice has broken buckle up for the ride.<br /><br />The police were pretty stupid if they knew this guy was dangerous, why didn't they shoot him in the head when there was ample time to do so? He stood in full view of the cameras, it would have saved 2 lives and a woman getting shot in the face.</p>

	<p>The way to honour the hostages who have died, and the other hostages who endured this terrible ordeal, is to oppose irrational, primitive supernatural belief systems. The first image I saw on TV this morning was a smiling islamic couple asking for tolerance. How dare they? What they, and all other believers should be doing. is urgently applying self-reflection and analysing their illogical and divisive religions.<br /><br />A number of ex-muslim public intellectuals who possess moral integrity and intellectualn honesty make a direct connection with the ancient myths and their promotion of violence.<br /><br />There is no place for unevidenced mythology in the 21st century.<br /></p>

	<p>To all appearances the event was the act of a lunatic, and fortunately not nearly as bad as Port Arthur in 1996.<br /><br />What needs to be examined however, is the criteria for granting asylum to asylum seekers.

	<p>How to honour the dead:<br /><br />1. stop the courts continually bending over backwards to treat criminals like victims and ensure violent criminals are not allowed out on bail - dozens of charges against this guy and he was free to roam the streets because in the Magistrate's words &quot;not a threat to the public&quot; ??? I wonder how that Magistrate feels this morning...<br /><br />2. come down harder on anyone preaching violence - and I dont care whether it is one religion or another, or atheists. We have laws against inciting violence. How about we enforce them. If a particular religion feels like they are being picked on - maybe a little introspection is required. Why is their religion so regularly being used to preach violence?<br /></p>

	<p>I dont have a problem with race but I do take offense to socially unacceptably divisive cultural practices.Paint it any way you like but once again it was a muslim event,the belief seems to allow for extremist views....you dont see other creeds propogating such behaviour.Dogooders need to wake up and see multiculturalism works as long as we dont infringe on their values....then of course it works.</p>

	<p>&quot;you dont see other creeds propogating such behaviour&quot;<br /><br />Oh I think you do.  It's not religion, its tribalism that's the problem.  Whether it be expressed via religion, ethnicity or nationalism, it's all the same thing - hating the &quot;other&quot; - and plenty of Aussies are just a guilty, no matter how they self justify it.</p>

	<p>the hostage taker has a proven record of violence against women. As Minister for Women, Abbott should use this tragedy as an impetus to address and tackle domestic violence and especially violence against women as the number one national priority. unfortunately, being the opportunist that he is, abbott will only use this tragedy to stifle more of our freedoms and rights and turn australians against each other. Divide and conquer! Eventually anyone criticising the govt about anything will be deemed as &quot;identifying with the ISIS death cult&quot;.</p>

	<p>The best way to honour the two innocent dead would be if our highly paid magistrates and judges started doing what the community has been screaming at them to do for years... put people who have a long string of criminal offences behind bars when awaiting new trials and dont give them bail.. how many more people are to get killed before they get the message.</p>

	<p>A terrible tragedy, but thankfully one at this time, does not appear to have a direct link with a terrorist organisation.<br /><br />There will no doubt be some in the political sphere that will try to make the connection.<br /><br />What is concerning for those of us that have no religious affiliation is that we will have to suffer for the unrealistic beliefs of those that are free to indoctrinate the young minds of those within their grasp, that their own particular God, one of many, is the only true God.<br /><br />We build churches, mosques, allow sects to flourish and perpetuate ancient myths. Then we give them tax free status.<br /><br />It is a forlorn hope that many of these religions will peacefully co exist.</p>

	<p>The genesis of The IS movement was in prisons from known criminals and murderers. Having a united banner, gives a group of psychopaths the opportunity to behead children indiscriminately. It drags in disaffected young from families who often have a religious domain at home.  <br /><br />The only cure is to wage a proper war and defeat them. Much as that is just sooo, politically incorrect and offends the left - who will be beheaded and brutalised as any others.</p>

	<p>Well said Tim, I do agree with the things you said. Nevertheless, I would expect more from Muslim community. As a former Muslim let me share some of my perspectives when I tried to argue about Islam with Muslims. When you try to go ahead and address the problem of extremism in Islam, they all go to a defensive position and argue that they are the victims and jihadists are not related to Islam!! They have to acknowledge shortcomings in their religious first to solve the problem. if they don't acknowledge it, the problem remain unsolved, and believe me I tried to explain to them but almost all of them deny any shortcoming in Islam and went to a defensive position and doge the question with criticizing me as an outsider. Long story short, I would like to hear from Muslim leaders to say we see the problem of Jihadists in Islam, we are deeply sorry for that and we are working to resolve the problem. Only after such an acknowledgement we can go ahead and tackle the problem.</p>

	<p>When hostages are killed during a prolonged siege, then someone has messed up. (and that's being polite) So who has messed up? (polite again) I nominate Scipione and Baird. They both need to go.

	<p>I honour the victims of the Sydney  siege in the same way as I honoured the victims of Hoddle Street massacre or those of Martin Bryant in Tasmania- as victims of a deranged nutter.<br /><br />At the same time I am grateful this one was not as deranged as the others who murdered  many more innocent people. <br /><br />While we do not know what drove the Hoddle Street and the Tasmanian murderers we seem to know that religion and real or perceived victimisation drove the Sydney tragedy.<br />The man was delusional- he had hate in his heart and yet seemed to believe he was a man of peace. In that he is not alone- a few world leaders past and present suffered from the same delusion.<br />I suggest we wait until the Police finish their investigation before rushing off to judgements. One of the most disturbing aspects of the siege was the never ending media cover. We had journo after journo each giving their opinion and speculating -always ending up with 'but we do not really know&quot;. Repeat after repeat of the same words and images.<br /><br />We will get through this- as we did with Hoddle Street and Tasmania- it is what  people everywhere do- they get over tragedies- I expect no less of us.<br /><br />However Tim is right in that we do not allow this tragic event to generate hate- that would mean those who would do us harm as a nation for religious or geo political reasons have won.<br />That is the best way to honour the victims. RIP.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>It seems many people above are very angry with the judicial system that granted bail to the gunman.<br /><br />Perhaps it is time that the Magistrate involved had his performance on the bench scrutinised.<br />Has he / she released others who have gone on to commit crimes? <br />What is his / her success rate in giving bail. <br /><br />I would suggest that the performance and decision making of all magistrates be regularly assessed and published. <br />Those who make continual error should be removed - good decision makers get promoted.<br /><br />It's time the ivory tower of judges / magistrates was brought into the modern era and made accountable to the society they are sworn to serve.</p>

	<p>Your reference to Islamic attire brings us to a most interesting consideration.<br /><br />Surely; if the Islamic community is so willing to embrace the Australian way of life, then any overt dispplay of what has hitherto not been part of the Australian way of life should be avoided.<br /><br />The Australian population of 2014 is largely made up of immigrants.  Immigrants who have become Australian without the need to show the rest of the population that they really are not trying to fit into Australian ways.<br /><br />The Italians, the Greeks, the japanese, the Chinese.  All have absolutely integrated to the extent that one could never differentiate them from any other Australian, apart perhaps, from physical differences.<br /><br />So why is it that seemingly, the majority of the non-male, and frequently male members, of the Islamic community feel the need to portray themselves as &quot;different&quot; - and for no religious reasons whatsoever.  Most of us could not give two hoots as to what socio-political group they belong to.  What is important to us is that they are law abiding and respectable citizens.<br /><br />Rightly or wrongly, it is this phenomenon which ensures that there will always be a divide between members of the Islamic community and &quot;the rest of us&quot;.<br /><br />And I do subscribe to such initiatives as the #illridewithyou, but such initiaives should simply not be necessary.  Were members of the Islamic community less overtly &quot;different&quot; there probably would be no problem whatsoever.</p>

	<p>What I cannot understand is why our media, particularly the ABC, are so reluctant to condemn anything associated with radical Islam and Islam in general. Religious satire is OK for any other religion but not Islam? Why is only Islam a taboo for any unfavourable comments? We are we so tolerant and accommodating to the excesses of some Australian Muslims. We all know that they are only a small minority while the majority of the Australian Muslims are decent, law abiding citizens. Nevertheless the law abiding majority could not be offended if we condemn the excesses of the small minority?!  Therefore why we are giving our Muslims such special and privileged treatment. Why not treat then exactly in the same way as all other Australian citizens. Lets treat the decent, law abiding citizens with respect and lets identify and condemn the criminals irrespective what religion they belong to.</p>

	<p>The best way to honour those lost in this tragedy is to act quickly and strongly to strengthen Australia's borders by denying refugee status to anyone arriving without a passport.<br /><br /> Yes, I hear the strident calls from the refugee industry advocates and beneficiaries but much louder I hear the crying of families who just lost a loved one.<br /><br />Viewed as radical in Iran, why was this man allowed to enter Australia?   More importantly why was he not deported for his actions in Australia after his arrival?   This man was allegedly persecuted in Iran for his radical views.   <br /><br />Does that mean our immigration staff and refugee advocates would have let other radicals into this country because they were being persecuted for their views?  There are jihadists being persecuted in Syria right now... do we open the doors to them? <br /><br />We have our share of crazies in the West also..   some of them are or have been leading political figures.    Its time for people regardless of religion to demand better of our leaders who shamelessly use the people to cement their own immortality.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>Of course the majority of Muslims are lovely, peaceful people as are the majority of Christians, Hindus, Buddhists. But that is not to deny that religious belief is a form of mass delusion based on supposed sacred texts that have utterly no proof of their supposed divine origins nor the persons who inspired them. This sad incident in Sydney reminds me of a meme I saw recently showing souls ascending to &quot;heaven&quot; from Earth with the text saying:  &quot;And God raptured all the religious people and there was suddenly peace on Earth&quot;. Perhaps a bit of an over-generalization but certainly a significant fraction of humanity's violence is caused by religion.</p>

	<p>I am very dissapointed by this tragic outcome and bloodshed.  The Police response was chaotic, unprofessional and it seems that their preparation is poor. Instead of bragging, they should have been trained to deal with situations like this. I am sure that the German Police or the French Police (or any other European police force) would have handled the situation much better. In my view, there was no need to storm the building and use live amunition when it was possible to find a peaceful resolution to the standoff.<br /><br />It is the same unprofessional people who ruin the Australian economy, healthcare system, eductaion system, drag this country into wars and send Australian jobs overseas...</p>

	<p>When the Government raised the level of terrorism alert a few months ago, some people on this site were saying that they were only doing that because they wanted a distraction from the budget. They were stupid then and look even more stupid now.</p>

	<p>I hope that the Cabinet National Security Committee now stops having meetings on this siege - clearly this can now be seen as a matter to be dealt with by the NSW Police and the Courts/Coroner, there is no National security risk or crisis, no need for the Cabinet to meet or for the PM to hold Press Conferences, no need to paint this as having National implications (I'm not downplaying the tragedy of the loss of life and wider impact on the families)</p>

	<p>Look at the background and the current circumstances of this serial pest. He was a desperate religious fanatic loser facing serious gaol time, a ticking time bomb looking for somewhere to go off. It has nothing to do with being &quot;deranged&quot; or &quot;ill&quot; - that's what people say when someone does something they cannot imagine themselves doing. Most horrific acts are committed by sane people (exhibit A the video beheadings).<br /><br />The real worry about this event (leaving aside the issues of ill-advised delay in police action and the baffling release on bail of a high-risk serious offender) is the continuous media feeding frenzy that is still going on. How many times does this sort of thing have to happen before the media realises that THEY are the main reason it keeps happening (terrorist attacks, mass shootings, high profile hostage situations etc).<br /><br />This guy was always on a suicide mission. The only question was how long he would wait and how many others he would take with him. He was determined to go out with a bang.<br /><br />In the meantime, courtesy of the saturation media coverage, this psychopath is ramming himself front and centre on a global stage before an audience both horrified and mesmerised by his callous, ruthless exercise of power over his victims, who to him are his enemies. How many other angry alienated muslims (yes muslims, who else does this kind of gig?) watched all this and thought &quot;Wow. This guy is awesome.&quot; Before today he was a nobody, an insignificant loser. Not any more. Now he's about as high profile as you can get.<br /><br />And other nobodies, insignificant losers, are watching.</p>

	<p>Rather than praising the police and governments, surely we should be asking why this wasn't avoided.<br />The gunman was on bail, and has a long history of alleged offences.<br />There were recent raids in Sydney and elsewhere which apparently showed Martin Place was a target.<br />Why was this bloke free on bail if he posed a known risk?<br />We don't need more laws. We don't need more religious and racist bigotry.<br />But we do need the existing laws to work properly, and intellegence to be used to protect us.</p>

	<p>As an Australian living in the USA, I am grateful for journalism that encourages peace and unity amongst members of the nation, rather than division, alienation, and separation.  The world will always has its bad seeds that choose to do evil and then blame it on religion, and these people can be dealt with by the appropriate agencies, but the truth is that there is no reason why people from different factions can not live in harmony and learn tolerance towards each other.</p>
