       The GP co-payment changes will, if passed, be the most determined attack on the Medicare system ever contemplated. <span class="source">(AAP)</span>
      </a></div>
</div>
  <p><strong><em>The original $7 GP co-payment plan may have been unpopular, but Tony Abbott's new proposal is something far more serious and sinister, writes Mungo MacCallum.</em></strong></p><p>One of the more irritating aspects of our frequently exasperating Prime Minister is that even when he does a backflip, he doesn't do it properly.</p><p>There is never an apology, or a retraction: he was always right and now he's still right. It was a good policy, now it's a better policy. You should have been happy before, and now you ought to be delirious. But the punters are not convinced.</p><p>Of course, there are times when Tony Abbott won't admit there is even an issue in spite of overwhelming evidence.</p><p>Take, for instance, the ludicrous and hypocritical suggestion that the problems in his office stem not from the obsessive and dictatorial arrogance of his chief of staff, but from the sexism and misogyny of his colleagues. Those of them who have had a gutful of Abbott's enforcer, whether her name is Peta, Peter, Lucrezia Borgia or Genghis Khan, are not impressed.</p><p>And even when he moves to assuage or counter public criticism, he can't bring himself to offer more than a token. Julie Bishop's belated announcement of the $200 million to the Green Climate Fund - the despised Bob Brown Bank, masquerading as environmentalism under the guise of socialism - is better than nothing, but not much.</p><p>Even Abbott's fellow recalcitrant, Canadian Stephen Harper, has kicked in half as much again, while Japan's contribution was $1.5 billion and without strings attached. Australia will pay its instalments over four years, if it makes the payments. And it will not be new money anyway: Abbott will raid the already depleted foreign aid budget, something Bishop had vowed never to do. Another public slap down from the Prime Minister to his loyal deputy.</p><p>But by far the most important tergiversation of the past week is the apparent ditching of the $7 GP tax, and its replacement. This is not only serious, but downright sinister.</p><p>The headline good news is that pensioners, children and concession cards holders will be spared, which comes as a welcome relief to much of the neediest section of the population. But the far more ominous bad news is that the changes will, if passed, be the most determined and far-reaching attack on the Medicare system ever contemplated other than downright abolition.</p><p>To explain, we need to go back to the long and fraught history of our much loved universal health care scheme. When, nearly 50 years ago, Richard Scotton and John Deeble provide Gough Whitlam with what was then Medibank, their peculiar genius was the idea of bulk billing.</p><p>The determinedly independent body of Australian medicos would not submit to any concept of what they called socialised medicine, so they did not get it: they were allowed to continue to set their own fees at their own levels. But there was a sweetener; after consulting the profession, Medibank set up a schedule that would determine the commonwealth government funded rebates that would apply for the appointments and procedures.</p><p>The individual doctors could charge what they liked, but any gaps they demanded they would have to bill for themselves, involving their own bookkeeping. But if they chose to go stick with the rebates, there was virtually no paperwork: patients would sign a form assigning their payments to Medibank and Medibank would send the proceeds to the medicos' accounts - a big saving in time and money.</p><p>The specialists were not interested; they demanded real money, and much of their income came not from the commonwealth but from the states, through the public hospital networks. The Medibank rebate was a welcome bonus, but that was all. But a great many GPs, after some initial resistance, came round to the idea of a guaranteed minimum income without the need to burden a secretary or a receptionist to double up as an accountant. And so bulk billing became the core of Medibank, and, when it was reformed and rejigged by the government of Bob Hawke, of Medicare.</p><p>As time went on the Medicare levy of 1.5 per cent rose to 2 per cent (with a surcharge for high income earners without private health insurance) but it was not sufficient to secure the rising health budget. Hawke tinkered with the idea of a co-payment, but was rebuffed by his colleagues and by the GPs themselves, who had settled very comfortably into the long-standing regime. It took another generation for Abbott to revive the idea.</p><p>Obviously it was wildly unpopular with the public, and it was criticised by Labor and many others as an attack on the whole idea of universal Medicare. It was, but at least the co-payment was up front: the patients had to cough up their $7, which the medicos then handed over to consolidated revenue under the guise of a research fund. It would be expensive and time-consuming, but it was, in its own way, straightforward.</p><p>However the new version, even though the amount of the impost is to be reduced, is underhand, mean and sneaky. Instead of a co-payment from the patient, there is to be a deduction in the rebate from the doctor.</p><p>The Government is still to get the loot, but the doctor is faced with the choice of collecting it from the patient, or simply forgoing the income. Thus the GP will have to select whom and when to charge the $5 (or a part of it) and go through the unpleasant and task of getting it, processing it, and banking it him or herself.</p><p>The frustration and resentment will fester on both sides. And in the end, a lot of doctors will decide that it simply isn't worth it: they may as well forget bulk billing altogether and go back to a system of user pays, where they can charge their own fees, which will, because of the extra expense involved, inevitably go up.</p><p>The Liberals have never liked the idea of Medicare and public health; now they have devised, under the faÃ§ade of a compromise, an insidious and possibly fatal attack on it. This is not barnacle removable - it is blitzkrieg. It is to be hoped that the Senate will have the perspicacity and determination to hold the line and protect what has been acknowledged as the Whitlam government's greatest and most enduring legacy.</p><p><em>Mungo Wentworth MacCallum is a political journalist and commentator.

	<p>Any more time with Abbott is too much time. If you have chronic health issues, it is hard enough for an average family coping with medical bills without this complication. Abbott has no compassion; only feigned emotion stated when he needs to.<br />I cannot believe someone without an overarching plan is elected to what I would like to believe is basically an educated and intelligent country. Perhaps the dumbing down of our country started way earlier than first thought.<br /></p>

	<p>Mungo, unfortunately Medicare is not able to continue in its current form indefinitely. It is an inexorable and mathematical certainty that costs of providing medical care are outpacing the ability of Medicare to meet the costs. <br /><br />Therefore it is a necessity to ask 7 out of 10 people to pay a contribution to allow the disadvantaged 3 out of 10 to continue being cared for at minimum cost. <br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>This is not about Medicare being unsustainable. As Christine Milne points out, it is about feeding the rich by robbing the poor. This is about driving the bulk-billing practices out of business. 1.  If anyone can afford to bulk bill, it will be the big corporates the ancillary rebated services such as pharmacies pathologies, and can therefore subsidise the prescribing service. Of course there is a huge conflict of interest, and it is really surprising that the govt and ACCC allow it to happen. 3. As more people start paying for the GP, this will be opened up to the insurance companies - again a business that is subsidised by the govt. through the rebates. 3. Reducing access to primary care means people will fall sick more often, increasing secondary care costs. Public hospitals, starved of money, are sending patients into the private system, which is far more expensive.<br /><br />These changes are not about saving money. It is about handing over even more public money to big business.</p>

	<p>&gt;  If anyone can afford to bulk bill, it will be the big corporates the ancillary rebated services such as pharmacies pathologies, and can therefore subsidise the prescribing service.<br /><br />The current model of the big corporates is to bulk bill and push through as many patients as possible. If you assume 8 patients an hour that is a $40 hit every hour. Five rooms at 12 hours each day equates to $2400 in lost revenue. It will be interesting to see if this is sustainable.<br /><br />Smaller practices that provide bookings provide greater continuity of care, but rarely to these practices bulk bill so there is already a two-tier medical system.</p>

	<p>Good points.<br /><br />Firstly, corporatized General Practices are a blight on medicine. They have industrialised the process of mining Medicare to pillage the system. They have furthermore vertically integrated their pathology and associated services to milk the system all the way through. If they are forced to introduce a price deterrent and to provide a simple 10 minute consultation it will break their business plan which is a good thing. 5 minute medicine is crap medicine.<br /><br />Secondly, it doesn't have to prevent a patient from accessing health care. If one's health is not worth $5 or even $20 then one should re-examine one's priorities in life.<br /><br />I do believe this will hand over less money to big business and lead to more discerning use of Medicare resources. And if you don't believe that then why are the doctors groups and the AMA 'going bananas' over this.</p>

	<p>So now we are heading towards the US health care system. <br /><br />And hasn't that been a resounding success ? Highest fees in the world, death rates increasing.<br /><br />In many US states kids are living shorter lives than their parents did. <br /><br />Who wouldn't want that ?

	<p>It would be interesting to know how the referral rates for pathology differ if the employer practice has a snout in the trough of the pathology provider.<br /><br />I am willing to bet that an overseas trained saturday afternoon stand in gets a fair bit of not so subtle pressure to order a certain number of blood tests.</p>

	<h3 class="">Had a poor year:</h3>
	<p class="date">16 Dec 2014 9:09:36am</p>
	<p>If you want to put a figure to the fact that most people paid into the Medicare levy: due to having only limited income  last financial year, I paid a grand sum of $80 in tax. Of that, I was relieved of $20 for the Medicare levy. Higher income earners paying the levy? Good grief, I was on a high income and never knew it!<br />Seriously, while theoretically I don't mind paying for subsidised health care, my long term doctors wasn't bulk billing me, so I paid heavily for absolutely unavoidable medical care, skimped on the rest and other expenses as well THEN paid out extra. As a Queenslander, we had a much better free system, funded by the Golden Casket, before Medibank/Medicare  ever existed. Stuffed up by the Whitlam Govt in the name of universal healthcare.</p>

	<p>&quot;Medicare is not able to continue in its current form indefinitely&quot;<br /><br />Believe it or not it is possible for taxes to increase as well as decrease. If we all want universal healthcare free at the point of access then we have to pay for it. Medicare levy at 3%? 4%? Why not?</p>

	<p>Citizen, while I wouldn't argue too much with you over this point - Mungo clearly doesn't much like Abbott - I think his point is more directed in this article towards the means by which Abbott's new plan is going to collect this co-payment.<br /><br />It's a co-payment by another name, and a somewhat sneaky one at that. I think Mungo is right to criticize the means - not necessarily the ends. GPs may well crack the sh*ts and not play the bulk-billing game, and I believe that would be of great concern to many Australians.<br /><br />I agree - we probably can't sustain the increasing costs from the existing Medicare levy. What other options are there? A means-tested or indexed Medicare levy for those without health insurance?  Set threshold for GP visits per annum that do not attract a co-payment? One-off annual means-tested GP allowance for disadvantaged Australians, and when you've used it up, you pay the full co-payment thereafter? <br /><br />Perhaps the bureaucracy associated with managing these spitballs is anathema to some and will be duly shot down, but some creative and equitable  thinking on this policy is clearly required by the Government.<br /><br />It's going to be hard to simultaneously set a price signal for a service while ensuring individual safety and democratic access to a fundamental necessity.<br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>Sadly you have a tenuous grip on reality.  Australia's health costs have remained at around 9% of GDP, a remarkable experience considering how expensive new generation diagnostic machines are.<br /><br />The crisis is that the cost of health is dramatically climbing in terms of its proportion of fiscal incomes.  As our economy grows, tax revenues, as a proportion, have shrunk.  John Howard promised too many income tax cuts, and Kevin Rudd was foolish enough to deliver them.<br /><br />The solution is for the Commonwealth to tax more, something this administration appear loathe to do.  What we need is a treasurer with some courage, someone that can imagine the budgetary solution as involving more than only cutting services to the sick and the poor.</p>

	<p>Yep you get what you vote for. Either the people who voted them in were happy with the &quot;wheel of fortune&quot; approach offered to them or didn't read the fine print. Too many people voting on one issue without really thinking about the rest of the package not in Tony' budgy smugglers. They will lead us into recession in which case they have a hell's chance of being re-elected unless they pull several rabbits out of hats. On the basis of what I've seen no bad thing really. They have polarised and not united the country and in a realitively conservative nation like Australia thats some achievement from a conservative govt.</p>

	<p>so what is the proportion of Labor voters 'that cant make a point without throwing a lie into the mix Zing'? Here's a start on an estimation: there were 6,006,217 Australians that voted Labor at the 2013 election; you post a large proportion; assume that a large proportion is greater that 50 percent. If you are right then there are around 3 million liars in Australia and that doesn't include Tony Abbott.<br /></p>

	<p>@Zing,<br /><br />Seriously? Your argument is that Labor voters sometimes lie. Therefore, politicians shouldn't be bound to honesty?<br /><br />Labor and the Greens don't even hold the balance of power in the senate. Then again, I'm sure you already knew that. And it's hardly &quot;wrecking&quot; if they are blocking measures the LNP had no mandate to implement to begin with.<br /><br />Perhaps it only seems like Tony Abbott is being held to higher account over his honesty than Gillard (he's isn't) because he ran on the platform of open and transparent government.</p>

	<p>Zing, the Coalition and their supporters couldn't go a day without mentioning 'no carbon tax under a government I lead'. It is as if they thought that accusing Gillard of lying about it a thousand times was the equivalent of a thousand lies. This is completely different to the numerous unforced lies that Abbott tells.<br /><br />At the press conference to announce his new tax on sick people, Abbott was asked if he had discussed it with doctors first. He instantly said 'yes' despite the major medical associations only finding out about it 20 minutes before the press conference. Abbott lies by reflex, even if he doesn't need to. It's in his DNA. <br /><br />For the record. Gillard promised a price on CO2 pollution. She didn't get a majority and part of the requirement from the independents, to form government (not 'lead') was to bring forward her plan to price CO2. Abbott was under the same requirement (see 'Windsor tells Abbott a few home truths'). <br /><br />So even when the Coalition and their supporters are claiming lies from Labor it is often a lie in itself.</p>

	<p>I'm assuming Yank made these comments before the events... in which case I think some people's definition of lying needs to be re-examined.<br /><br />He can't be lying about speculation of the future unless he knew what was going to happen.<br /><br />That aside. There is nothing to fear in Sydney City, unless you're going to let the random actions of a disturbed individual scare you. Don't let them get to you. Sydney is a safe city compared to a lot of other places in the world. What happened was tragic, but should not be used to fuel exaggerated fear. Fear is the seed of doubt and division.</p>

	<p>The policies of Mr Abbott are debasing politics. How could a PM<br />be so opportunistic in his decision making and so hypocritical in<br />his behaviour?

	<p>PCROSBY and therein lies the problem. Abbott is making up policy 'on the run'. He has no vision, nor established goal to aim for, therefore no real guidance. Unfortunately it is a method occurring in many an organisation, including the public service. Without it, management keeps plugging leak after leak instead of looking at the whole system.<br />His so-called policies are not actual policies.</p>

	<p>That is why this government has stooped to a regulatory step in reducing the rebate. No need for legislation passing through the senate. I think, and please feel free to correct me if I am wrong, that the Senate has the power to veto the regulatory change similar to the way they acted when they vetoed the Freedom of Financial Advice regulations. Considering Palmer and a couple of others from the cross bench have come out and called this 'stupid move' (my opinion) a victory I do not expect the Senate to act. I really hope they do act, if they can, but don't hold your breath.</p>

	<p>Fair summary Mungo.<br />There aren't too many GPs still practicing who remember what it was like working before Medibank came in, but it was a vastly different era altogether. Patients required far fewer visits each year, and had fewer therapeutic or diagnostic interventions available. While phrases like &quot;burden of Chronic Disease&quot; and &quot;ageing population&quot; might now seem quite glib, they have very much changed the workload of the average GP. Sadly, those patients who do the right thing by society, and try to continue working and contributing despite their illnesses without a concession card are going to see yet another barrier to their medical care come up, while the GPs who have been trying to provide their care without additional expense are finally going to reach breaking point.<br />All after Peter Dutton stated in 2011 that rebuilding quality General Practice would be his first priority in Government!</p>

	<p>Hello barsnax<br /><br />On the whole I agree with your comment. I do have a doubt with the below quote<br /><br />unfortunately people expect the government to keep them alive<br /><br />I can't stop thinking about expensive fresh fruit, fast food, rows and rows of junk food in supermarkets, advertisement enticing people to load up on sugar and how main stream it all is in our society<br /><br />My point is the government makes millions maybe billions in taxes from companies poisoning our fellow citizens.

	<p>True - it's an appalling backflip (the correct word in this case as he's doing the same thing, only differently, no U-turn in sight), which will affect most of us as well as the doctors. &quot;Price signal&quot; nonsense, when the so-called stats that appeared to show we all visit doctors too much were misread completely. It makes me very angry.<br /><br />I can also recommend today's Fairfax column by Ross Gittins, on the whole sleight of hand, the so-called medical research fund and the probable effects of this policy decision.<br /><br />I think we need a new &quot;It's Time&quot; campaign.</p>

	<p>The current LNP government uses &quot;prices signals&quot; only when its convenient for its mates.<br /><br />It gleefully &quot;axed&quot; the price signal that was the carbon tax.<br /><br />It wants to put a price signal on sick people (or their doctors), but it runs away from any suggestion of a price signal to encourage preventative medicine. For example, a tax/levy/impost on sugar.</p>

	<p>That is a fair comment, JB.  Many GP's have said that many of the people whom they see have life-style health issues.  If the government is serious about wanting to reduce expenditure on health, surely this is the place to start.  <br /><br />I recall that shortly after the election last year, the government delayed the implementation of nutritional star ratings on food.  Among other things, they said they were considerate of industry's concerns about the cost of implementation.  It is clear that for this government, asking individuals to pay more for their medical visits is preferable to asking business to outlay any money on schemes that can benefit our health (the cost of which they could actually pass on to the consumer).  Presumably the real problem for industry is not the cost of implementation, but the hidden &quot;cost&quot; of reduced revenue as consumers turn to other products.  <br /><br />The values of the government are clearly exposed.....they are not here to pass legislation in the interests of the community but in the interests of big business and their supporters.  It is this partisanship to the wealthy that is so destructive of our society and its foundations, and so amoral.  As you say, it was clear also in their abolition of a price on carbon......the well-being of fossil fuel companies was put before the well-being of our society.</p>

	<p>Losimpson, I think that this is the core issue that we are facing as a society.  There has been a change over my lifetime.  When I was younger there was a concept of responsibility to others and if one was part of any group with decision making power, one had a responsibility to consider all possible outcomes and select pathways in the best interests of all.  Today, it seems, individuals seek positions of authority and power for the express purpose of putting in place actions that reflect their own agenda and which benefit themselves and those who have the same outlook.  It is leading to divisions in society, conflict and social unrest.<br /><br />The underlying philosophy is that we are all individuals competing for resources and that any behaviour is permissible in allowing us to compete favourably with others.  If individuals can rise to power and have access to the levers of legislation then the view is that they are entitled to pull the levers to benefit themselves and those who support them.  And this applies to all positions, not just those of national government.<br /><br />There is, of course, a very false notion embedded in this.  We are not just a collection of separate individuals.  We operate as a society with various levels of social grouping, from family through to a nation.  We depend on others in living.  What anyone individual or group does, has effects on others.  We are far from separate.  Until we acknowledge this fundamental truth and that our well-being depends on our collective well-being and not &quot;what we can get for ourselves&quot;, then we will continue to live in an increasingly ugly, disharmonious, destructive world in which our very survival is at risk.  Turning from the notion &quot;individual: good, collective: bad&quot; is up to each and every one of us and will involve us getting a grip on our greed, self-importance and belief in our own superiority and omnipotence.  It will involve us acknowledging our fundamental humanity and our connectedness to other beings, human and otherwise.</p>

	<p>&quot;much loved universal healthcare system&quot; - much loved by those who don't pay for it, I'm sure. I'm not so starry eyed.<br /><br />I pay $70 for a GP visit, I get $30 back from Medicare (round numbers). The rebate gets reduced by $5. I get $25 back. Nothing to do with the doctor/practice, who still gets my $70. I'm happy to kick in an extra $5 to help the nation, even though I already had a hefty &quot;price signal&quot; to begin with.<br /><br />I will also never again go to the doctor for a doctor's certificate for what I know perfectly well is the common cold &quot;rest and keep up your fluids&quot; and I will negotiate this stance with my employer. I have further taken stress off the system by saving additional rebates.<br /><br />The question then is what does the practice do with the people it bulk bills - and it will bulk bill some things (follow up on a general health blood test for most people), and some people (the elderly, health care card holders etc.) I assume. It gets less back but provides the same service.<br /><br />Seems to me it has to pass the costs onto those who are already paying - ie. me, by increasing the $70 consultation.<br /><br />Thus, I, who already have a significant price signal, now have a bigger one, and those who don't (the permanent bulk billees), who never had one, still don't - and if they're meant to be the problem (the idea behind a co-payment in the first place being to give people pause to think about whether they need to go to the doctor), then what's been achieved?<br /><br />Those who were already paying, pay more.<br /><br />If there was an argument there that some people who weren't paying were &quot;abusing the system&quot; and going to the GP frivilously, then how does this policy do anything to solve this perceived problem?<br /><br />And I speak as someone largely in agreement with liberal values, the current government direction, if not some of the specifics etc.<br /><br />And I'm not complaining about paying more - happy to chip in for the good of the country etc.</p>

	<p>If this hurts GP's as it clearly is designed to do then some of them will seize bulk billing all together. The result of this will, as Mungo clearly states, lead to higher charges for all. Further more those patients who were previously bulk billed will either, no longer visit a GP even when they really should or turn up at Hospital emergency rooms. Bad for general health and bad for state economies who fund public hospitals. <br />Any Government should realise that general health cover for all is a public good, if they included dental as part of medicare in twenty-thirty years time overall medical costs will reduce, good oral hygiene leads to better general health. But to expect this government or the Labor opposition to think about the next generation is a forlorn hope.</p>

	<p>In actual fact you're in the minority, it's only about 20% of the doctors that don't bulk bill apparently, most young families would probably be bulk billed as GP's realise the cost of raising a child. It's a big cut in wages for GP's that only bulk bill, some will have to pass on the cost even tho it will mean more accounting for them, therefore higher costs. The rubbish that was sprouted about too many visits to the doctor has been dismissed as a misleading statement (lie). The only way to make the healthcare system break even is to raise the medicare levy that will catch the people who don't pay now &amp; miss the people who can't afford to pay. This government has already stated it won't raise taxes as it may affect the economy, can't do any more damage than they have already!</p>

	<p>David I am jealous. You only pay $70 for a GP visit? Where I live it is commonly $90 for a GP. And much more out of pocket for specialists but not much difference in Medicare rebate. In my family there are 3 chronic illnesses requiring regular treatment, medicine and hospitalisation. We have no concession cards, pay Medicare and have Private Insurance. We could choose to go through Medicare for every hospitalisation but the amount of time in waiting room when holding jobs just doesn't cut it. We certainly do not choose to go to medical appointments for fun!<br />I suspect if this becomes reality we will not have a cent left for our retirement and will be relying on old age pension....</p>

	<p>You both need to find new primary care practitioners. The AMA is still happy to continue the lies about GP shortages and medico shortages in general. There are now doctors unable to find work because of an oversupply of graduates and foreign trained over the last 5 years. In my rural community there were over 20 qualified applicants for the latest GP job vacancy. A price signal will not be necessary soon as all these trained practitioners are desperate for patients and your custom. There is no shortage of doctors. Just a shortage of your negotiating with your practice manager. It is a product for purchase that you are after and you should offer less than the 90 dollars. They will probably say yes if you are a regular patient. There are plenty of practices out there that are after your custom and will charge less to retain your business. Look elsewhere. Register for eHealth so you retain your medical records no matter where you go. You may be surprised at how much you can save.</p>

	<p>Well said David.<br />The last time I saw a G.P. was about six years ago. The first question they asked me at the desk is if I had private cover. Then they asked if I had a concession card and next to hand over my medicare card. The man I saw seemed like a nice guy, but his grasp of English wasn't too good and I couldn't be sure he really understood everything I said to him. He was a locum. I saw him for about ten minutes and it cost about $80. That's a rate of around $500/hour, or $4,000/day if it's 8 hours, though some doctors work longer.<br />I am all for supporting those who are genuinely poor if they have medical issues. I dont want to see a system like they have in the USA. But all pensioners aren't the same. Some would struggle to pay more while others wouldn't.<br />Also any discussion of this issue must include the (virtually guaranteed) income of doctors. The AMA being in my view the most powerful union in Australia, is probably one reason that point rarely seems to come up. Remember the fuss they made a few years ago about insurance? They have a &quot;captive market&quot; unlike lawyers or accountants and again unlike most of the above, their income mostly comes from our taxes. Additionally there are the &quot;extras&quot; doctors receive from drug companies and the like. I don't think doctors are struggling financially. <br />That said, The entire health system needs very close examination. G.P.s are probably the least significant of the costs involved and I would guess, comparatively the best value for our money.<br />Have a good one.</p>

	<p>&quot;I will also never again go to the doctor for a doctor's certificate... and I will negotiate this stance with my employer&quot;<br /><br />Good luck with that if you're a factory worker or a shop worker or a nurse or a teacher. Maybe you have that kind of negotiating power, much most workers do not. They will still have to burden Medicare with their request for a sick note, but now it will cost them $5 to be sick. That's nearly an hour's pay for many minimum wage workers as a penalty for not being well enough to work. Sounds fair, eh?</p>

	<p>&quot;Another public slap down from the Prime Minister to his loyal deputy&quot;. And that says a lot about the fear Abbott has for his much more popular deputy. Even to the point of sending Robb to 'chaperone' Ms Bishop in Peru - clumsy and humiliating. <br /><br />Here's a prediction - first leadership spill before December next year. Ms Bishop is in a strong position, having been a loyal deputy to two former leaders. <br /><br />So long as she can keep the grubbiness of the Bernie Banton case - and her part in it - out of the papers, I can't see anything to stop her. <br /><br />After all, just about everyone else is on the nose. Abbott is clearly past being taken seriously, his chief of staff is despised, then we have Hockey who has spiralled out of control. Turnbull has lost his gloss after looking weak as when Abbott sent Bolt and Jones after him for daring to have a snack with Clive without putting his hand up, and as for the rest, well there ain't no one.<br /><br />Oh how the worm turns.</p>

	<p>Personally I think J Bishop would be a backward move on the LNP's part, she is seen as cold &amp; calculating with no soul, no one will forget the attitude she had in the Bernie Banton case! IMO they have few choices that are either smart enough or popular enough to take the job, pick a new leader &amp; go to a double-dissolution election, that will give the electorate the choice which major party policies will stand up to scrutiny as after this debacle no party is going in wishy-washy policies that could win!</p>

	<p>Mungo, don't fall for the government line about a $7 GP co-payment.<br />This was a specialist/pathology/radiology/ancillary medical $7 co-payment, not just for GPs.<br />The ALP has been silent on this issue, too.<br />There has been a lot of chatter about not letting &quot;the needy miss out on medical care&quot;, but Bill Shorten needed to stand up and say &quot;We will vote against ANY co-payment&quot;, but he has not done so.<br />Although the ALP is willing to brand the new sneaky scheme as one of &quot;Abbott's lies&quot;, Bill Shorten has not stood up to it and opposed it unequivocally. <br />He needs to.</p>

	<p>Well done prof, the penny's finally dropping.  The ALP &amp; Liberals have been working together on a number of issues not to the benefit of Aussies health.  You may remember 2010 when we got a heralded drum announcement of The Carers Recognition Act 2010.  This came into effect 2011 just in time for a range of multiple backdoor changes to the Social Security Act &amp; process in 2012  with an aim clearly of making the Carer Payment amongst other pensions virtually unachievable for anyone but the terminal &amp; their carers.  Have a look at Wayne Swans vision for 2050 (report) and you'll see policies not unlike what's being offered up now.  It's a little hard to speak up about something you started the ball rolling on.</p>

	<p>The Machiavellian Shorten, previously a union head, will say anything to be divisive, and will never, ever,  admit to anything that actually needs to be done. <br /><br />Note that Shorten's replacement actually advised Swan on his hand out tactics.<br /><br />I'd love to see him get in power.

	<p>Yes my sentiments also, WS.  I too, am looking forwards to seeing him in government. Shorten should be careful what he wishes for. So should those who intend to vote for B.S. in 2016. The ALP could have asked Faulkner to lead them. Instead it was a undemocratic contest between two union manipulators driven by personal ambition. Faulkner would have made a great P.M. in my view, someone we could all trust and respect.<br />Have a good one.</p>

The fact that you cannot see this is rather amazing, as one would not think that it would have been too difficult to have brought down a budget that had an appeal to all sections of the community.<br /><br />You will find that Labor will be able to rein in some unaffordable welfare initiatives where necessary, and at the same time stop the excessive middle class welfare.<br /><br />It was just stupid for the Coalition to expect that the lower income earners should do all of the heavy lifting.</p>

	<p>Waterloo: 26 years may be a bit of a disadvantage for you to gain a full historical insight into Australian politics. However you would have been here when Howard had revenue coming out of his ears, and it was not only chrome utes, but three cars and a boat, with a four bedroom home. On top of that, middle income tax cuts, and other benefits.<br /><br />Profligacy began with Howard, and because the Coalition, in opposition kept telling us that He was the best Prime minister since Menzies, Labor no doubt has difficulty in winding back his expansiveness.<br /><br />As I said it should not have been too difficult to bring down a budget where the pain was felt across all taxpayers.  Do you not agree?<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>Well, he let us down on the pension age increase, and the waiting time for the dole, when the ALP joined with the Liberals to vote this one through in the Senate -- even though the Libs did not need the Labs vote.<br />Bill is strangely silent when the Libs taunt him with the line &quot;you just block our legislation&quot;, because they know Bill doesn't want to put up his paw and say, &quot;Not true, we voted with you to make life worse for the elderly and the unemployed!&quot;.</p>

	<p>Health Minister Dutton has said that something like 80% of doctors in the Woollahra electorate bulk-bill. Given the devious nature of this Government, I wonder what exactly he means:<br />1. the doctor does not ask the patient (sorry, leaner) to pay the full cost up front and then take their paperwork to Centrelink to get a refund - he probably does mean this.<br />2. the doctor charges only the scheduled fee, and does not ask the leaner to make any payment, but sends an electronic bill to Centrelink for payment. I doubt it.<br />3. the doctor claims the scheduled fee electronically directly from Centrelink and as a separate exercise charges the patient the balance of the full cost. In this case the government would not see the over-the-counter transaction and would be able to say the doctor bulk-bills because he/she uses the EFT system.<br />It's a bit like (OK, a lot like)not mentioning that the Government will make extra from cutting $5 off the rebate, because they'll get the extra tax on the extra $5 &quot;income&quot; received by the doctor.<br />About time some inquisitive journo asked the PM, Minister or Treasurer about this.</p>

	<p>well said Mungo, what I find galling about this 'so called backflip' is the acceptance of the lies Abbott mouthed off so deliberately before the election. He has been caught out big time lying to gain what he wanted, then, introducing this disgusting attack on Medi Care. Just because he finds a 'back door' method to refine his lies, does not mean it is now acceptable. His team of apologists, blindly accept and excuse the lying and allow him to shrug it off as if we, the people and those who will suffer for his attack, don't matter. If this policy is allowed to go ahead, I fear for what this Idealist Coalition has in store for us. It is  a boil, not, a  barnacle on our society as a whole. It needs lancing and the deliberate, conscious liar Abbott  needs to feel the impact of a size 10 boot on his scrawny lying 'toosh' as he is booted from our minds.</p>

	<p>I am sure that Tony Abbott sleeps in a circular bed as he cannot lie straight in anything he does or says. Everything he has done since being a minister under Howard to now; has been underhanded, selective and is biased in favour of the rich to the detriment of the poor.<br />His first foray into the $7 GP co-payment was a disaster as we already know. Now he wants to say he has fixed all that and come up with a much fairer solution to the problem. Just remember that Tony Abbott is a compulsive liar and will do and say anything to distract from the real truth. I am going along with Mungo and believe that his new solution is sinister and will affect all patients as well as the doctors. Time for a new government.</p>

	<p>Go beyond just rejecting the latest impost!  Call time on three decades of bad policy!  Now, at the end of 2014, we should be discussing the Big Issues. Successive governments have, for instance, quite deliberately allowed the gap between Medicare rebate and scheduled fee to widen, so that many patients are now paying a &quot;co-payment&quot; anyway - a point far too seldom made during the debates.  <br /><br />Fees harm the most needy.  Individuals are now spending $18.9 billion out of their own pockets on healthcare due to policies intended to benefit private health - twice as much as health funds contribute to the health system.  <br /><br />Claims in the Intergenerational Reports that Medicare is financially unsustainable are intended to serve a Laberal political agenda.  Spending on age and service pensions is expected to grow over the next 40 years by 1.2 percentage points to 3.9% of national income (GDP).   That is easily manageable.   As regards the projected increases in health care costs, some 60% of the projected increase is ?non-demographic?, meaning that it will arise from the demand by people of all ages for more healthcare.  <br /><br />Whether or not a comprehensive national dental scheme would cost $4-6 billion, it would be money far more efficiently spent by government funded by taxation than individuals trying to get something from the patchwork quilt of private health insurance with its many traps and pitfalls. <br /></p>

	<p>Yes, the $7 co-payment wasn't the greatest idea....<br /><br />But those of us who want to defend the basis of Medicare understand that we can't provide &quot;free&quot; healthcare to the entire population through a Medicare levy at its current level.  Just do the maths - there's about $10b a year short.<br /><br />To me, the solution is obvious - increase the medicare levy to whatever is needed to fund the system.

	<p>I absolutely agree with you Huonian. Your solution is equitable and fair to all users of the system. A 2% increase to the levy would cover all extra costs. For those people on thousands of dollars a week income, they would provide the bulk of the income. On the other end of the spectrum; the retirees (not self funded or wealthy), unemployed and disadvantaged would still get all their treatment for free. A 2% increase in the levy is far less than all those 11 tax cuts Peter Costello introduced to keep the Liberal Party in government. Maybe an increase of 2% to all wage earners would help get the budget back to normal as well, or is that too simple? Traitorous Tony or Horrendous Hockey would never do anything to upset their wealthy friends who donate huge amounts of money to the Liberal Party. The Liberal party need to get their priorities straight, something they are incapable of doing.</p>

	<p>Thanks, Mungo. Your more detailed analysis very welcome. The coverage of this revise co-payment has been overall woeful including the initially risible political spin but still aq lingering descriptor of the rebate cut as &quot;optional&quot; or &quot;voluntary&quot;. This is a pea and thimble trick that to those usually bulk-billed but without any concession status will face in most situations a new $5.00 fee.<br /><br />For the rest of us now accustomed to paying about $75.00 for a ten minute consultation (about a 100% &quot;co-payment or &quot;private fee&quot;), we shall receive $5.00 less in our rebate.<br /><br />The whole payment goes tot eh GP/specialist and the rebate comes to us.<br /><br />There are also some negative details in revised rebates for shorter consultations. A cut of course.<br /><br />I believe Mungo is correct: this is an initially quietish but determined onslaught on Medicare itself.<br /><br />Is it not time for serious political leaders to both advocate and then lead the debate around an increase in the Medicare levy (- a progressive tax) rather than milking tiny amounts of money from struggling &quot;average&quot; Australians?<br /><br />Think about that. How can we sustain the Medicare system without structurally increasing the revenue stream? Especially with an ageing population.<br /><br />As to a &quot;price signal&quot;? That would require clear evidence that the system is being over used. I have seen none of that evidence. If the government's intention is to suppress legitimate GP's visits/primary medicine, that is plain stupid. That approach clearly would cost us much more overall ultimately.<br /><br />Another example of no vision, no careful, workable strategy and no consultation with all stakeholders including us citizens and electors.</p>

	<p>Good background Mungo, but there's more to be said.<br /><br />The government says it will freeze the amount doctors receive from Medicare until 2018, which means that, as doctors' costs increase over the next three years, they will have to either absorb the increases or pass them on to patients by increasing the patient co-payment amount. <br /><br />At the very least, this is likely to mean that the co-payment will increase in line with the CPI, but if costs (salaries of doctors and their staff, premises, rates, power etc) increase more rapidly, and if any increase is at the doctor's discretion, then the rate of increase of the co-payment could be higher than CPI. <br /><br />In addition, if I've understood correctly, the rebate paid to doctors for consultations of less that 10 minutes is to be roughly halved  and, if that happens, it's hard to see how doctors could absorb this cut.  It could even lift the initial co-payment for short consults above the $5 figure mooted by the government last week.<br /><br />The net effect of all of this is that:<br />1.	the government saves $5 per consult on medicare payment to doctors (for consults of 10 to 20 minutes) and around $16 I think on consults of less than 10 minutes. <br />2.	the out of pocket cost to patients will increase by $5 per consultation AS A MINIMUM, <br />3.	the cost to patients will go up over time (is effectively indexed to CPI or higher at the doctors' discretion) without the government having to put anything through parliament to legislate the increases, and <br />4.	taxpaying patients will therefore end up pay four times for GP delivered health care ? <br />a.	through their taxes, <br />b.	through the Medicare levy, <br />c.	through any gap they currently pay their doctor, and <br />d.	through the new &quot;indexed&quot; GP co-payment.<br /></p>

	<p>Really good update.<br /><br />Just some additional information:<br /><br />The rebate for consultations 6-10 minutes will be reduced from $37 to $16 in January and then reduced to $11 in June 2015 and will be frozen until at least 2018.<br />The rebate for concession card holders and children will be reduced by $5 for all consultations if the patient is not bulk billed.   (expect a couple of chronic disease items that can not be used for acute health problems and can only used for a small group of people and limited to 6 monthly. These are also frozen.)<br /><br />Once doctors have to bill, no one will be charge $5. Minimum gap for concession card holders will be $20 ( $5 + $6 BB incentive + $9 accounting/ bad debts). Non concession holders will be charged more, especially to make up for lost rebates on shorter consultations and the ongoing cross subsidy for people GPs will probably always BB eg the homeless, the children living in poverty, severely mentally ill etc. I would suggest at least $50 for a 15 minute appointment.</p>

	<p>Wendy, I wonder how you'd feel about a 15% pay cut. If you do the maths you will see that GPs aren't especially well paid. Practice overheads are about 50% of practice revenue, or if like many, the GP works in a corporate medical centre, they are paid 50% of billings. Despite the claims of six minute medicine, most of us average about four patients an hour. The Medicare rebate for a consult of up to 20 minutes is $37.05, so hourly income for the GP is $74. Annual income for 48 weeks at 40 hours a week (and believe me that is a soul destroying slog) is $142k. From this comes super, income protection insurance, medical indemnity, self education expenses etc. Not too flash considering the years of training and the responsibility. When you take your business elsewhere I am certain you will get exactly what you pay for. When quality general practice as we know it ceases to exist I wonder who will be blamed.</p>

	<p>They asked the troops to take a pay cut and lose annual leave, now they're asking Doctors to take a massive pay cut, or force people who may already be paying a large gap to pay even more per visit.<br /><br />Note the how easy the possibility for a transition to a full (and failed) user pays system such as they have in the USA, it could potentially become from there. <br /><br />Once the insurance companies have a stranglehold on healthcare, insurance will be a pipe dream for most, and become a bargaining tool to reduce salaries/wages.<br /><br />What's that?.....Crickets??... I don't hear the pollies offering to take a 15% pay cut, or lose annual leave. Nor do they want to be responsible for the push of Australia towards a proven failed medical model. <br /><br />Nor will they have to beg for insurance, be too poor (through no means of their own doing) to afford to pay upfront fees, or be forced like mentally ill veterans are to deal with the reams of paperwork online by closing DVA offices, where they used to be able to get face to face help.<br /><br />This policy is about as well thought out as some of the recipe disasters you'd expect to see on commercial TV.<br /><br />To:<br /><br />LNP: We already have a user pays system, it's called Medicare. Hands Off; this country takes care of it's poor and needy as well as the wealthy and obscenely rich.<br /><br />The LNP voting Doctors: Sorry, but if this gets up, you'll have been officially thrown under the LNP bus for the sake of popularity.<br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>In Qld the insurance co's already have a strangle hold on healthcare!  The insurance co's cried poor &amp; a deal was cut between our govt &amp; insurance co's so that claimants have their payouts fixed at an amount per body part.  This amount was ridiculously low &amp; probably accounts for why Medicare is so highly valued in our State by people permanently disabled in car crashes &amp; at work.</p>

	<p>Thanks Mungo. <br />I don't think the Govt quite understands how the people love Medicare. Wether it be from first hand experience or using it as some sort of joke about Americas health system and how we would never be like that.<br />The party that wins the next election will probably be the one who sells Australians their country back. <br />From Medicare to the fair go , it wont be hard. But somehow , without a leadership swap , I don't think the winner will be the LNP.<br />Cheers.</p>

	<p>Ultimately this debate was really about the manipulation of the Medicare system by medical providers for increased revenue rather than availability of health care to the public. Unfortunately it is the government's poor governance of the system over the years that has let the system become too costly.<br /></p>

	<p>The increased costs of Medicare are largely due to increased proportion of patients sent by the GP for specialist care and the increased number of visits patients make as they age and gather more chronic diseases (while more people live longer and progress into this category). Making it harder/more expensive to see GPs risks reducing the primary health care of chronic conditions leading more to end up with the more expensive specialists. For example 3 monthly care of the person with diabetes leading to better control of diabetes leads to less leg amputations - Australia has done well in this regard in recent years compared with other countries.</p>

Their job at this point in time is to oppose what the deem goes against their parties values (you know, fair go for all etc). Oddly enough, I already know what the Labor party stands for. They do not, at this point in time need to set out policy positions. Its not their job. But when they do, closer to an election, you can bet ir will be more than 3 word slogans, point form briefs released the day before polling, unlike your neo-lib mob.</p>

	<p>Tony's &quot;Team Demolition&quot; is probably a more appropriate description of this Govt.. Demolish all that Australian's hold dear &amp; have pride in, is not what we want. But the LNP Govt. has just turned a deaf ear to what the electorate want or don't want.<br />Todays MYEFO has nothing new in it, just the same old bash the low income sector, no new policies for getting the country back on it's feet. Does Joe Hockey think that the cut backs &amp; draconian measures he announced in the budget are going to get the budget back into surplus then he is delusional.<br />The original back to surplus was going to be in 2016-17, now it's 2020-21 but in reality it will be never, unless they create new jobs &amp; stimulate the economy &amp; that cannot be done by cutting low income earners &amp; pensioner incomes.<br /></p>

	<p>One can only wonder why the Government does not impose a Medicare levy surcharge for excess visits to the GP during the year (say more than 6 visits per person), and use all monies raised for support Medicare funding. <br /><br />This solution is superior to the Government's ridiculous proposal for the following reasons.<br />(1) Less money needs to be raised to produce the same reduction in the Medicare funding/cost gap (as all funds raised are directed to Medicare)<br />(2) Money raised is not being used for a completely unrelated purpose, such as a medical research facility (so people will come on board and support it)<br />(3) It sends an effective price signal to people (so misuse would be reduced)<br />(4) It only applies to excess visits (so people will not be discouraged from making a reasonable number of regular visits to the GP)<br />(5) Only people who currently pay the Medicare levy would be liable for the surcharge (so pensioners and people not liable for Medicare are not impacted)<br />(6) The surcharge could be higher for people who pay higher Medicare levy (so those who can afford do pay more)<br />(7) A safety net provision could be built in, for people who need to make many visits to their GP, such as people with chronic illnesses (so people with a genuine need are not unduly burdened).<br />(8) It can be administered via the tax system, alongside the current Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge, as Medicare has an electronic record of all Medicare GP claims (so no need to involve doctors, or complex or expensive administration)<br /></p>

	<p>That might be a good idea but how would you work out the safety net - I imagine most people who make many visits to the gp do because they have lots of medical problems. Also those with lots of medical problems tend to be older and/or pensioners/and/ or not well off (perhaps because of their illnesses), so this might not provide much of a disincentive to gp visits if that is what the government wants.</p>

	<p>The safety net could be set at (say) 10 percent of their Medicare levy. <br /><br />However, if the Government was really serious about closing the Medicare funding/cost gap, then include all Medicare services in the surcharge (over a reasonable minimum free amount) and set the safety net at 25 percent of Medicare levy. That would definitely work.</p>

	<p>Picking a group to target for this co-payment is as good as putting up a No Fruit Fly's Past This Point sign.<br />To not have free access to doctors for all in a tropical environment is not just stupid its dangerous. Ignoring the viruses we already have, with the number of imported goods entering our poorly monitored ports (how did fire ants get in &amp; redbacks get out)it is only a matter of time before a lethal virus hits our population.  Many of these start with symptoms similar to a common cold.  Many workers faced with a co-payment on top of the hour wait at doctors are going to soldier on.  This will be done to the detriment of business productivity as they will infect everyone on the bus/train to get there &amp; home, everyone at their work, everyone at the caf? where they lunch etc etc.<br /><br />Whilst meriting the value of a national dental health scheme you can pull the other one (pardon pun) if you think this money is going to be spent on health research for the benefit of Aussies now or in the future.  If any of this money sees the light of day you can bet it will go to the almost half mill Liberal Party contributors who have an interest in medical research (you can add tobacco co's to this list now they need to test E-Cigs).  Have a good look at the millions spent from NDIS that hasn't even bought a building to house disabled participants.<br /><br />It's time Aussies start to stand up for the health of all its citizens &amp; make all pollies aware where our priorities lie.</p>

	<p>Thanks Mungo. Long may you live and prosper.<br />And dear Citizen Medicare as it is must remain as it is because it is one of the certainties that helps to keep Australia a reasonably safe place. It should not and must not be  in any way so called 'watered down.' In its own right, it is a safety net in and of itself.  Politicians of all persuasions. Hands off. Run deficits every year if that is what you have to do. To be debt free may be a wonderful feeling, but generally the reality is that it is virtually an impossibility when there is so much that needs to be done.</p>

	<p>I think the only part requiring senate approval is the ability of practices to charge the copayment. I have a document from the prime ministers office which states that the item descriptor for level A (brief) consultation and reduction in rebate of $5 will commence on 19.1.2015. They are making quality general practice unsustainable.</p>

	<p>Practice manager, I worked for Medicare for 15 years and in that time I rarely saw any practice charge for a Level A consultation. Virtually all GP's charge for a Level B consultation, even if it was simply to find out test results or for issuing a repeat prescription. Has your practice ever seen this?<br /><br />http://www9.health.gov.au/mbs/fullDisplay.cfm?type=note&amp;qt=NoteID&amp;q=A5<br /><br />A Level A item will be used for obvious and straightforward cases and this should be reflected in the practitioner's records.<br /><br />A Level B item will be used for a consultation lasting less than 20 minutes for cases that are not obvious or straightforward in relation to one or more health related issues.<br /><br />I do not agree with the latest Government proposals, nor do I condone the billing practices of so many clinics that do not abide by the spirit of the Health Insurance Act 1973.</p>

	<p>All this talk of price signal assumes that basic public health provision is a market i.e. that the major driver of choosing to seek  primary medical advice is price. This has been debunked in the health literature for years.<br /><br />A great deal of health care is a matter of necessity.  A sickness or disability that requires access to treatment, the ridiculous requirement of an employer to get a sickness certificate. Even if a price signal delays access to care, the outcome is not likely to be reduction in cost to the system overall, because infections are spread and more complex treatments are needed.<br /><br />A price signal  and market assumptions are likely to reduce the efficiency of a universal health system.  Funding the system from population funds makes sense as with any shared risk insurance system.  Funding must be from a tax or levy base according to ability to pay. The rampant individualism of Abbot, Dutton and Barnes flies in the face of worldwide evidence.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>The Liberals want to basically destroy the concept of 'public'. Everything bar defence, internal and external, must be run completely by their corporate mates. With defence it will only be 'mostly'. <br /><br />They are smiters and destroyers. They don't want to govern or build and don't know how to. They want to have society as a small powerless subset of the economy. Signing 'free trade' agreements with ISDS terms is proof of that. It is the removal of the democratic right of future Australian people to elect a different form of government. We will be ruled from international courts of commerce with no rights of appeal.</p>

	<p>Good article. The aim of Hawke's co-payment was the opposite of what Abbott is doing. Hawke introduced a co-payment on direct-billed consultations (concession holders were exempt and the safety net was also introduced) to encourage patients to go to bulk-billing doctors. At the same time, the rebate for non-bulk-billing doctors was reduced by more than the co-payment, so the whole aim was to encourage bulk-billing, not eliminate it.  Three months later the co-payment was abolished, but bulk billing remained. <br /><br />Even if none of this were the case, Abbott's justification for what he is doing by referring to something which happened nearly a quarter of a century ago really goes to show just how reactionary he is.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Abbott views the sick as leaners.</p>

	<p>While the $5 copayment has been handled extremely badly by the government, this article is yet another to add to the fact-free hyperbolic list of critical commentary. A $5 copayment hardly resembles a possibly 'fatal' attack on the health system, and the author is wrong in saying the Liberals consider public health care antithetical. What they're trying to do, in an admittedly ham-fisted way, is to clamp down on 5-minute medicine bulk-billing clinics - rapacious businesses that would struggle to deliver good health outcomes with their volume-driven profit model, and they also want to force people to accept the fact that a trip to the doctor is never really free. This latter point is Liberal ideology, and not a rejection of public health care. Despite the overblown claims, there is simply no evidence presented by anyone (including the government) that a small copayment will lead to poor health outcomes - in fact the issue has undergone very little research. A PubMed search I did found one article that looked at the issue - the result was that a copayment of small magnitude seemed to have no effect on health outcomes. The government's best policy would have been to explicitly clamp down on 5-minute medicine clinics, and I'm not sure why they couldn't find a way to deal with these taxpayer-exploitative businesses alone. The entire issue should never have been raised until the government came up with facts: on how much overservicing goes on, and who gets it. They also should have researched behavioural patterns when a copayment is required. For an area like medicine that prides itself on evidence-based practice, this lack of data is ironic.</p>

The health system is already different if you have money or if you don't.   There will never be a 'universal' system with the same care levels for everyone. I think some cost at the time of the visit is appropriate.   Most are already paying a significant amount at a consultation but the reality is that there is a huge Government deficit and some pain is going to be felt in a large range of areas.</p>

	<p>Based on most of the comments of LNP supporters medicare should be scrapped, or so it seems. After years and years of mismanagement by both major parties and diluting any benefit this programme now provides to be nothing like it originally offered us (cast your mind back to the time when Medibank was first introduced; 100% hospital cover, 80% of the population bulk-billed, and those that weren't received a rebate amounting to 87% of their bill; and no compulsory health insurance outside of medibank).<br /> Considering medicare as we now know it appears to have run it's course maybe it should be done away with entirely. <br />Of course the States would then have to find additional funding to run their hospitals, but with many general practitioners having to close their practises due to the downturn in the number of patients seeking treatment, maybe these hospitals could reign in much of their overheads by taking on some of these now redundant medical practitioners.<br />After all aren't these the very same people the government are suggesting are over-servicing us by providing us a service that many among us have no real need.<br />And when it comes to the Australian population being over-serviced which we are repeatedly told by this government maybe along with next mob sacking of public servants we could also dispense with the services of at least half the members in both houses, after all government services, like those provided by our health providers don't come for free.<br /></p>

	<p>Firstly, as mentioned by several people in the past (and seemingly always ignored by supporters of the Prime Minister): The co-payment is NOT going towards Medicare, therefore any discussion about the fiscal responsibility bonus of the co-payment plan is moot.<br /><br />And of course I want more medical research. Which is why I am still mad about the fact funding was taken away from R&amp;D (in the year 2014...), then this carrot was dangled in front of us. It's a carrot that was stolen from us, and is now being sold back to us at $5 a pop. It's the old cons that are the best.<br /><br />I'm also not certain why it is taken for granted by many that raising the Medicare Levy and looking at the untested private health rebate cannot fix Medicare's issues (or at least bring them to manageable levels). It would certainly do more than funding going towards a fund that will likely be depleted as the budget 'crisis' is worsened by our government.<br /><br />Progressive methods of avenue raising tends to be most equitable and most effective. Those who can afford to pay more will pay a little more, those who cannot to pay more will pay what they can afford. <br /><br />Over all, taxation is already skewed towards the rich (even without taking into account the effects of clever, expensive accountants). This is not 'unfair' skewing, mind. Those who earn more should get to keep more money, otherwise there would be very little point in job and wage differentiation between a doctor and a freelance journalist...<br /><br />And that's the point of progressive taxation. It's not asking two people who are earning the same amount to pay vastly differing percentages. It's asking someone who can afford more to pay in more, but still end up with much more than what their budget requires. Low income families can struggle more with tax as what is 'left' is a lot less (as they have a much lower starting pool).<br /><br />A flat-rate or regressive tax (which a co-payment effectively is) is unfair and a much heavier burden to lower-income families, or even families of average wealth. <br /><br />The result would likely something similar to China or the US, where public hospital waiting rooms are filled with people needing GPs (for those suggesting GPs move into hospitals to reduce waiting load, try wading through a Chinese hospital hall). People do not make a choice to get sick, and it is fundamentally unfair to ask someone on minimum wage to pay 1/3 of their hourly pay just to see a doctor.<br /><br />Coupled with changes to Newstart and the feet shuffling with the slow-to-come Disability Insurance, coupled with a trend towards casual and part-time employment, this will find young people from average to low-income backgrounds the hardest hit.<br /><br />And with the recent studies showing that wealth is being accrued by older Australians at the detriment of the young already, it seems those who can most afford to pay, and would pay a little more than young families, also</p>

	<p>I have chronic ailments and visit my doctor regularly.  If the $5 was used to improve the provision of primary care , and maybe to reduce hospital waiting times, I would wholeheartedly support it.  I do believe a modest co-payment would rationalise our consumption of medical services.<br /><br />This appears not to be so, however.  Using a GP tax to fund an obscure research fund is an obvious example of a poorly targeted user-pay tax.  It also reveals the bare-chested, extreme, and out of touch philosophy of this government.<br /><br />I don't believe this is what the vast majority voted for, and they seem to be beyond redemption.<br /><br />I think it is sad that the only viable alternative to the ALP has become a weird and unpredictable group that do not represent the wishes of the majority.</p>

	<p>Mungo you are wrong. The previous proposal DID include a rebate cut. The current proposal ticks all the boxes. Those that can't afford to contribute to their healthcare still get free care and the GP has the same rebate. Those that can afford to pay - like yourself - will contribute all of $5 and the doctor will be able to access Medicare for the remainder of the fee. Access for all, affordable and sustainable. What more do you want Mungo! And what sort of wonderland of milk, honey, infinite funds and make believe do you live in!</p>

	<p>The $5 payment has grabbed the attention, but other changes announced will kill off bulk billing.<br />* Freezing the rebate for 4 years while costs rise will squeeze GPs.<br />* Cutting the rebate for a 9 minute consultation with a GP from $37 to $11 (or $16 for pensioners) will ensure people are charged, probably for &quot;standard consultation&quot; of around $80<br />* Refusing to pay GPs to do Chronic Disease Management when a patients attends with their list of scripts, referrals, a cold, a skin check, a drivers licence and a centrelink form is especially stupid, and will ensure people end up with complications requiring more expensive hospital treatment down the track.</p>
