  <p><strong><em>Perhaps the greatest achievement of the climate talks in Peru wasn't the goals set, but the fact that international talks like these make it increasingly hard for breakaway countries to ignore the issue, writes Christian Downie.</em></strong></p><p>After more than two weeks of negotiations at the United Nations climate talks in Lima, Peru, political leaders finally announced over the weekend that they had reached an agreement. For the first time, all countries, rich and poor, are expected to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, which are causing climate change.</p><p>The agreement calls on countries to publish their so-called nationally determined contributions to reducing global emissions ideally by March next year, and certainly ahead of the negotiations next December in Paris, where much of the detail is to be finalised.</p><p>Much lip service will be paid to the outcome in the coming days, especially the divisions between rich and poor countries, which have plagued the climate negotiations for almost two decades. But the question for many sitting back in their lounge rooms watching the evening news is do these negotiations matter?</p><p>At the opening of the negotiations Rajendra Pachauri, the UN's chief climate scientist, stressed the need for countries to take urgent measures in order to limit the global rise in temperatures to no more than 2°C. That is the point at which the impacts from climate change become unimaginable. If you want to try - just imagine the next bushfire season being worse than the last, until in 30 years from now loss of lives and homes seems an almost annual event.</p><p>The UN talks will not stop this from happening. As the US secretary of state, John Kerry, put it: "We are on a course leading to tragedy."</p><p>International negotiations alone won't change the course, but if combined with domestic actions they just might. What countries like the US and China do domestically will have a much greater impact on future reductions in greenhouse gas emissions than any announcement in Lima.</p><p>For example, China's decision last month ahead of the G20 summit to stop its emissions from growing by 2030 could have a significant impact on our chances of keeping temperatures within the so-called 2°C guardrail.</p><p>Likewise president Obama's announcement that the US would emit 26 per cent to 28 per cent less carbon in 2025 than it did in 2005 will do the same. Also, the US president's decision to impose tough new rules on power plants is already having an impact on the US coal sector. For anyone who doubts that this is true, just ask US coal companies and electricity utilities how much harder it is now to secure investors following the announcement.</p><p>Every time countries reaffirm their desire to address the problem it tightens the hold on those who want to do nothing.</p><p>So it is government domestic actions that matter most. These actions are the only way we can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But this is the key; international talks like the ones held this week increase the pressure on governments to act. Every time countries around the world reaffirm their desire to address the problem it tightens the hold on those who want to break away and do nothing.</p><p>Witness Australia's decision at the talks to contribute $200 million to the Green Climate Fund, which only one year ago Tony Abbott described as a "Bob Brown bank on an international scale". While the contribution is small compared to other countries, the backflip reflects the mounting international pressure that the Government is facing on climate change.</p><p>Although the decisions of countries at a national level to phase out coal, or switch to gas, or invest in solar power, is what will really reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increasingly international gatherings, such as APEC and the G20 last month and the UN this month, are building pressure for domestic action. And every time they do, the harder it will be for governments at home to shirk their responsibility to slash carbon pollution.</p><p>If the message from our closest ally wasn't clear enough in Brisbane at the G20 summit, it just became clearer this week, as John Kerry argued: "If you are a big developed nation and you do not lead, you are part of the problem."</p><p><strong><em>This article was first published on <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/environment/" target="_self" title="">ABC Environment</a>.

	<p>I just love this article. It is a perfect example of the AGW deception. The meeting was an absolute, abysmal failure. Some of the biggest CO2 emitters openly told the Western countries that they don't have time nor money for the Western AGW propaganda. The actually agreed to nothing the Western countries proposed. However the AGW propaganda machine is in overdrive trying to spin it as some sort of success. It is absolutely laughable. <br /><br />Not long ago Chine told the USA that they would continue  their rapid increase their CO2 emission for at least further 16 years. However, the AGW propaganda machine tried to spin that as a &quot;great achievement&quot;. This example is even more funny. Absolutely ridiculous!!!</p>

	<p>Phil,<br /><br />It has been mooted that countries that have already taken steps to reduce the output of greenhouse gases that are causing the observed abnormal accelerated rate of climate change should be able to implement a levy on all goods/services coming out of nations that have not taken similar steps.<br /><br />As such with a 'greenhouse gas levy' (or similar name that suits you) being applied it will mean that those goods or services would be in less demand as the goods or services in the nation that has taken steps to reduce their output of greenhouse gases would be better able to compete.<br /><br />Western nations who have done the right thing therefore can apply financial pressure upon nations who haven't done the right thing to encourage them to do so.<br /><br />ps. it also levels the global playing field somewhat too.</p>

Why not consider consulting a scientifically reliable source of information (eg NASA, BOM, Brit Met Office) rather than denialist bloggers websites?

	<p>@ realist1<br /><br />So, in a paragraph or two you want me to summarise the science of global warming and the climate change it is producing, including climate modelling and the peer-review process. I could spend three hours doing that for you, or I could suggest that you just go look it up yourself (if you are GENUINELY interested in the answers to your questions). You could start by reading the IPCC report if you want a reasonably thorough summary of the current scientific views relating to your questions. If that is not detailed enouogh for you, you could consult the actual papers directly that the IPCC report references.<br /><br />I'll make a deal with you. I'll spend the hours thoroughly answering all of your questions if you first tell 'us' how the climate has NOT changed and how increased CO2 has NOT affected our climate ... maybe start with what the baseline normal climate is ... how they modelled that and peer reviewed it ... then just how the human CO2 emissions have NOT changed it ... good luck.<br /></p>

	<p>@ Andrew Thomas - I understand your sentiment, but let me explain my actions. I do not do it to try to convince those who are immune to evidence, as I realise that is impossible. I do it for those browsing these comments who are genuinely interested in what the current scientific view really is. As I care passionately about the truth and have the greatest respect for science, I feel a duty to correct misconceptions and rebut misrepresentations when I see them. I simply cannot stand by and let those who would promote misinformation (whatever their motivation is) to go unchallenged.<br /></p>

	<p>&quot;Theos, you are a climate change denialist.&quot;<br /><br />Thanks for clearing that up for me.<br /><br />&quot;The IPCC (read: mainstream science) has acknowledged the hiatus in warming...&quot;<br /><br />No they haven't. I know that is what the denialist blogs you visit tell you, but it simply isn't true. Now, either you know this and are deliberately attempting to mislead people, or you are simply ignorant of the facts. Even thought this has been explained a hundred times on this forum before, I explain it again. The RATE of warming has slowed. It has not stopped, paused or even hiatused. IT IS STILL WARMING. The IPCC report is VERY CLEAR about this simple fact. Clearly, you have not read the IPCC report.<br /><br />Serious suggestion - why not grab a copy of the IPCC report and read it for yourself rather than visit denialist blogs and simply take the bloggers word as gospel truth. Or are you happy to just stick you fingers in your ears and bleat &quot;la la la...&quot;?</p>

	<p>Does your &quot;no warming&quot; include the melting ice caps and the THERMAL expansion of the oceans or does your world only consist of its surface? Do you know the difference between temperature and heat?<br /><br />The melting ice (around 500km3 each year) alone absorbed 4 billion billion joules of energy each year, with the oceans absorbing more than 10 times that amount. That is hardly zero.<br /><br />There you go, some data. But I am sure you will still continue to push this misinformation. Do yourself a favour and investigate my comments and learn a little bit about science.</p>

	<p>Dear Mr Coochey, as you very well know, this is a complicated matter and it is impossible in a forum page of a limited size to go into all the details of climate change. What many posters have done though is pointed you to exactly where the information you request is found. To be honest though, a simple google search will do the trick. There is an amazing amount of published reports and studies and findings available. I'm not sure which search engine you use, but you need to update it. Constantly spouting nonsense which gas been debunked thoroughly does your credibility no good. I wish you would just say 'I John Coochey refuse to accept climate AGW as it means that I may have to do something about it, or it may cost me money'. At least that way we would understand your refusal to accept what is plainly obvious. That something is greed.</p>

	<p>Spacey obviously such matters are complicated and human activity has an influence. The issue is CAGW happening or not and is there anything that can be done.  The hypocracy of the warming zealots can be taken as read but what irks me are the constant assertions that &quot;the science is settled&quot; but whenever a simple question is asked we get widely different answers.  Flannery is on record saying if all human activity ceased it could take a thousand years for cooling. When Andy Pitman was asked the same question he said a couple of decades. When the Chief Scientist was asked to adjudicate (and if he does not know who does?) he answered he did not have a clue.  A previous Chief Scientist stated if we did not do something by within five years then all was lost. That was made just over five years ago. So....</p>

	<p>John I have this clearly iron clad way to sort out the dispute. All people like yourself who deny climate change through AGW and seem to love CO2, volunteer to enter a room in which the air is slowly replaced with pure CO2. Those amongst us with scientific training will observe from outside as you continue to tell us that there are no problems and that you have never felt healthier. That should sort it out don't you think - we'll even provide free food etc. for the length of the experiment - and not only that you have the opportunity to demonstrate the certainty of your ideas.</p>

	<p>Malcolm,<br /><br />I have another experiment. You and other like minded people who say that CO2 is a poison and a pollutant go into a bio sphere. There is abundant vegetation for food production, and all CO2 is removed from the sphere. The goal is to see how long the committee or I mean the community can survive without CO2. Those amongst us without scientific training will observe from the outside. There is no need to provide free food as you have the means to grow your own for the length of the experiment. That should provide the opportunity to demonstrate the certainty of your ideas. <br /><br />Anyway, what a silly and pathetic counter argument you made. I mean REALLY. Sit in a room with nothing but CO2 is the best you can come up with. I mean water is essential to life but too much will kill you, solar is the next saviour but too much of that will kill you, food is a must but guess what, too much of that will kill you, to much wind can kill you, too many puppies can kill you (yep I went  puppies as that makes as much sense as your counter argument). Just sad really and your point reeks of desperation.   <br /><br /></p>

	<p>Thank you for making my point for me.  The temperatures rose until 1999 and then stopped rising. The models did not predict that, and so shark you have torn up your driving licence and disconnected from the grid?  I think not.  The other thing that no one has yet commented on is how little substance there is in this article mostly wishful thinking.</p>

	<p>John, you have just proved that you are a off in your own little world of make believe .<br /><br /> Can you not read <br /> NASA Says &quot;With the exception of 1998, the 10 warmest years in the 134-year record all have occurred since 2000, with 2010 and 2005 ranking as the warmest years on record.&quot;<br />The temps have NOT stopped rising, you just WANT them to have stopped .They slowed , because oceans absorbed some of the heat .<br /> I'd like them to stop , we all would,  BUT THEY HAVE'NT. <br /><br />NASA again &quot;The average temperature in 2013 was 58.3 degrees Fahrenheit (14.6 Celsius), which is 1.1 F (0.6 C) warmer than the mid-20th century baseline. The average global temperature has risen about 1.4 degrees F (0.8 C) since 1880, according to the new analysis. Exact rankings for individual years are sensitive to data inputs and analysis methods.<br /><br />Comprende?</p>

	<p>&quot;The temperatures rose until 1999 and then stopped rising&quot;<br /><br />That is manifestly and indisputably FALSE. Read Mr Shark's comment above. The TEN hottest years on record have ALL OCCURRED AFTER 1998. It now appears almost certain that 2014 will overtake 2010 to be the hottest year since records were first kept. In no universe can you reconcile the measured temperature increases with your assertion that temperatures have stopped rising.<br /></p>

	<p>I walk the walk john as well as talk the talk. In the 80s and 90s i helped plant and grow around 30,000 trees. I offset my personal emissions and those of my family a long time ago . I feed into the grid via a 3kw solar array and have produced far more electricity than i have used for the last three years . I also don't have any bills . Before i went solar my bills were one third those of friends who had similar house and family size because i conserved energy and turned off all appliances ( apart from the fridge )when i went to bed . <br />For the past 20 years i have walked around at work turning off rooms full of computers and lights which others have left on as they are too lazy to turn them off, this saves the taxpayer money in addition to keeping down my workplaces emissions.  i have around 20,000 litres of rainwater tanks which service most of our needs. <br />Models are not perfect,  they are revised as they go along , as new data is evaluated and fed into the program. this is bloody obvious . As an economist i thought you would be aware of that , isn't it called  ' the inexact science ? &quot; so it goes with AGW which is , of course, the uncertainty that you and your kind exploit to cause uncertainty, dissention and doubt, making progress on this issue more than problematical....</p>

	<p>Hi John Coochey,<br /><br />Thankyou.  I was getting worried there for a minute that the scientists might be right this time.  But as history has shown us, the scientists get it wrong due to their &quot;belief&quot; in things like the scientific method, research and rigurous measurements followed by endless validation and peer review.<br /><br />Other mistakes scientists have made include:<br /><br />- smoking causing cancer<br />- Asbestos causing cancer and other resporatory issues<br />- The Earth not being the centre of the solarsystem<br />- The Earth being round.<br /><br />...... I could go on.<br /><br />Luckily, throughout history, we have had people like you to debunk those rotten scientists who spoil are little world views.  And why are they wrong?  Because you said so!  We need no other evidence, becuase evidence is for fools!!</p>

	<p>What he said,<br /><br />I think you may want to rethink your argument.<br /><br />The first scientists said smoking was good for you for various reasons. It was prescribed to actually enhance respiratory functions and to keep away various ailments.<br /><br />The first scientists has no concern with Asbestos hence why it was such a popular building material.<br /><br />The first common belief and believed for a long time was in fact we were the centre of the solar system. I believe it was a certain famous historical figure who went against the norm and was imprisoned for his beliefs that first put it up. HHmm, sort of like how certain people want to imprison or silence people who are against the norm now of climate science. <br /><br />The earth being round was actually believed and proved for a long time so I will give you that one.<br /><br />Luckily throughout history, we have had people to debunk the rotten science who spoil peoples little world views even if it contradicts there religion like catholics, muslems, climate change believers etc.</p>

	<p>John, you are right. Global temperatures haven't increased much in the last 20 years. I'm assuming you are using 1998 as your starting year for your statement. Why are you so focused on 1998. I'm guessing it probably supports your belief that there humans have no impact on global climate via human greenhouse gas emissions Most of us prefer to take the long term view, which clearly shows a trend of increasing global temperatures over the last 100 years+. I could as easily make the statement that global temperature have been increasing since 1999 so therefore humans are impacting global climate due to increasing level of greenhouse gases emitted by human activities.</p>

Australia relies on mining revenue.  <br /><br />When it is a conference there are actually joint bodies that mining companies fund though their own activities for their own activities.  <br /><br />It is very different from something like a climate summit where governments are pressured to pay in order to meet a select groups needs to feel good about international chatter.  The mining companies pay for their own activities and then pay money to governments.</p>

	<p>The main point of my comment, admittedly perhaps a little off the mark, but obviously lost on the 'deniers' or whatever you like to call yourselves, is that criticising scientists for attending a meeting on the climate change issue is just another example of the weak 'straw man arguments' that are the stock fodder of your input into any debate on this subject. Really, the best you can come up with is discredited science, repetition of illogical argument, unreasonable and crude attack of institutions and personal smear tactics. Same old same old. Clearly you have little idea of the way science works let alone any basic understanding of the concepts, otherwise you'd put forward concrete arguments for your case. Of course most thinking people understand that this is your weak and unfounded position, it's mostly the ignorant who are swayed by the propaganda from the vested interests of Oil, Gas and Coal, the cries of 'environmental socialism', and allegations of conspiracy theories; those who are so short-sighted that they consider investment in rapidly evolving alternative energy industries to be economically irresponsible. Unfortunately in Australia this includes quite a few influential people, many of them politicians and so-called business leaders.</p>

Are you of the view that everyone who attended the meetings in Peru can be categorised as an &quot;alarmist&quot;? If not all of them, when who? What is your criteria for classification?<br /><br />&quot;...meetings in exotic locations...&quot;<br />They have to meet somewhere. Perhaps you'd like to provide a list of &quot;non-exotic&quot; locations they should consider.<br /><br />And other than infantile cynicism, do you have any evidence that the officials meeting in Peru were &quot;partying on at taxpayers' expense&quot;. If you don't, they what is your justification for making such an allegation?<br /></p>

	<p>&quot;An alarmist believes in catastrophic AGW even though this has been discredited by science and observations.&quot;<br /><br />But what do you even mean by catastrophic &quot;AGW&quot;. By what criteria do you define catastrophic? If you live in certain Pacific islands, then a 1 metre rise in sea level will absolutely be catastrophic because your island will be under water. If you live in the north of England, and the flow of the North Atlantic Current changes, the local drop in average temperature may well be catastrophic. If you live in parts of the world where drought or brushfires increase in frequency and/or severity, then the term catastrophic may be suitable. If you live in coastal community where cyclone/hurricanes increase in intensity, along with the associated tidal surges, then for those communities, the consequences could reasonably be described as catastrophic.<br /><br />So, if I accept the mainstream scientific view which predicts that the consequences of anthropogenic climate change for certain people groups living in particular areas will likely be catastrophic, then that makes me an &quot;alarmist&quot;. Is that your logic?<br /></p>

	<p>Yes, Theos, you are an alarmist.  Because you are only predicting bad things are going to happen, as if change was not going to occur anyway, or as if issues other than climate change do not impact people worse, or as if attempting to stop climate change catastrophe does not potentially entail an even worse catastrophe.  <br /><br />A climate change realist recognises that the future is uncertain, and tries to gauge the balance of good and bad from climate change, against the impacts of taking action to stop it.</p>

	<p>Greig says &quot;Yes, Theos, you are an alarmist. Because you are only predicting bad things are going to happen...&quot;<br /><br />That's because anyone with even a fleeting knowledge of the principles of natural selection and adaptation, and how change affects this, will know that change generally isn't good.  <br /><br />Same for agriculture.  If rainfall decreases in the WA wheat belt, it'll probably become too dry to grow wheat. If rainfall increases in the same area, it'll probably become too wet to grow wheat. Change the crops?  Farmers in the WA wheat belt don't have experience with other crops, so this will have a negative impact too.</p>

	<p>Dr Who, anybody who understands the principles of natural selection and adaptation knows that change has always occurred.  There are people here who think that by reducing CO2 emissions we are going to stop climate from changing.  I despair at the idiocy.<br /><br />Further, changing crops in WA is not a catastrophe.  It is the nature of agricultural practices in Australia that we change crops to suit the state of natural variability - eg rice when it's wet, wheat when its not, etc.  We are good at it.<br /><br />You want us to spend $trillions in some vain hope that it might impact on global CO2 levels, and stop climate changing (as if) when simple adaptation is all that is required.</p>

	<p>Since sea levels are going to take eight centuries to rise 1 metre they do not need to be unduly concerned. The rest of your predictions are just conjecture. The world has always experienced severe weather events; now every time we have a storm or drought it is blamed on climate change. Looks like the alarmists are getting more and more desperate as the IPCCs' predictions are shown to be dud.</p>

	<p>Amber, you comment about sea level rise assumes that sea levels will consistently rise at less than one-third the current rate (3.4mm/yr). Sea level rise is accelerating, glaciers are melting more rapidly, Arctic and Greenland ice also. So where does your figure come from?<br /><br />One of the many things known about past climate and ice ages is that when the ice-caps melt, they melt quickly. This occurs in decades, not centuries.<br /><br />The increase in extreme weather events is a documented fact and again the data shows an acceleration. NASA and other sites discuss this and present the evidence.</p>

Or someone who lives on a low lying island that is at risk of unheard of regular flooding may believe in 'catastrophic' AGW.

	<p>@ Realist1<br />If someone denies the established scientific view - especially when they themselves demonstrate low levels of scientifically literacy and particularly poor skeptical thinking skills, and so have no rational basis on which to reject the expert opinions of the scientific community, then it is reasonable to describe such a person as a &quot;denier&quot;. However, the term &quot;alarmist&quot; is often used on this very forum to describe someone who merely accepts the mainstream scientific view. So, almost all of the scientific community are therefore &quot;alarmists&quot; for simply honestly forming a view of what the scientific evidence suggests.</p>

	<p>Only alarmists claim that catastrophic AGW is the established scientific view. There are thousands of respected scientists who dispute catastrophic AGW. The alarmist claim that 97% of scientists support their view has been totally discredited. When John Cook's 97%  was reviewed only 41 out of 11,944 papers, ( 0.3%), endorsed his claim that human activity is the cause of global warming.</p>

	<p>@ Amber<br /><br />More misrepresentations Amber. There is a tiny number of climate scientists who dispute the consensus. Several peer-reviewed studies have shown the disagreement to be less than 3%. Firstly, you are seriously misrepresenting the Cook paper. That paper is available on line, so anyone can read it and see whether or not you have honestly described it. I strongly suspect that you have never read it. But if you have a problem with that paper (because the denialist blogs you get your information from say it is bad), then you may want to consider the following peer-reviewed papers. <br /><br />Anderegg (2010)<br />Doran &amp; Zimmerman (2009)<br />Oreskes (2004)<br /><br />Please feel free to reply with the peer-reviewed studies supporting your claims.<br /></p>

	<p>Greig, I don't think anyone has denied AGW has slowed down - for pretty much the same reasons why it ran higher than expected for CO2 increase between 1970 and 1998.  (In neither case does it fundamentally alter the IPCC's outline.)  However, whether it has &quot;paused&quot; or &quot;increased slightly&quot; depends on which data set you want to look at, and either statement is statistically dubious - though the notion of a slight increase is better supported.  <br /><br />Oh, and rather than simply assert that the 97% concensus is wrong, take Theos up on his challenge and find solid refutations to the sources cited.  But I know that you won't do that, because you can't.</p>

	<p>Dr Who, <br /><br />I didn't say &quot;the 97% consensus is wrong&quot;, I said that there is no consensus on CATASTROPHIC climate change.  ie what scientists generally agree on is that AGW is real, not that it is necessarily bad.  Clear now?<br /><br />Otherwise I think you are defining the 15 year hiatus reasonably accurately, which is a welcome change.  ie It is not that we are observing that CO2 doesn't cause warming, it is still getting hotter, just not as fast as expected.  The point is that the rate of warming has slowed, and scientists don't know why (refer IPCC AR5 and SREX reports).  So current warming rate doesn't match the climate models.  This needs to be accepted and acknowledged, not denied as Theos is doing.<br /><br />My view on this is that CO2 is still causing heat uptake, but the atmosphere is warming much slower than expected.  This is important to policy makers, because it means that global warming will have much less negative impact than feared, and so we have more time to resolve it (eg steady reductions in emissions, orderly change of technology, etc).  It is good news.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>I can do no better than Christopher Brooker in the UK Telegraph<br />&quot;At least those 20 Greenpeace activists who desecrated Peru?s most sacred World Heritage Site with their propaganda stunt in support of renewable energy provided welcome diversion from the UN conference in Lima 300 miles away. There, 9,000 delegates have spent two weeks trying to agree on that ?universal climate treaty? they hope to see signed in Paris next year. In trampling over the 1,500-year-old ?Nazca Lines? etched in the desert earth, the ?environmentalists? can little have thought this would so enrage the Peruvians that they are now being threatened with six years in prison.<br />Lima is just yet another re-enactment of the three-stage ritual that has become only too familiar over the past 20 years. First, we are treated to months of ludicrously unscientific hype, telling us that the threat of global warming is now worse than ever. Then, they all gather in some agreeable venue, for the ?developing? nations ? led by China and India ? to say they will only play ball if the ?developed? world, led by the EU, the US and Japan, pays them $100 billion a year to curb their ?carbon emissions?. In days of acrimony and stupefying boredom, when the poorer nations bid up the bribe they want (some were this time suggesting it should eventually be ?1.5 trillion a year), it emerges that the rich countries aren?t really intending to deliver. The mere $1 billion promised to the ?Green Climate Fund? by Japan, for instance, is all going to Japanese firms to build three coal-fired power stations in Indonesia.&quot;</p>

	<p>Well Shark slagging off again because you cannot present arguments.  My point is that Booker seems to be able to foretall the future having written his piece before the Peru agreement (sic) was released.  Perhaps because it was totally predictable.  It is worth digging out who attended and how many were sent.  I remember seeing the list of tourists to the Cancun conference and there were several reps from Amnesty International which I am no longer a member of.  What were they doing there?</p>

	<p>My contention is , Mr C, that we can all present you with evidence over and over (as the likes of lisa Meredith has done over the years ) and you ignore all of it and simply repeat memes. <br /><br />I have posted evidence here today from NASA NOAH and the MET( who you are constantly misrepresenting with your claim that warming has ceased ) . <br />Unfortunately because you believe their evidence is false and tainted by self interest and ideology you will reject it.<br /><br />However, if suddenly they produced evidence that coincided with your views you would ignore their previous track record and would promulgate it far and wide as a fact that you are right . <br /><br />Lima is NOT a success , but its a start , if it had been a success you would have still criticised it roundly because, regardless of all the evidence of pollution, eco system collapse, extinctions etc, you  want to do business as usual because your self interest might be threatened.<br /><br />This is a well known phenomenon, amongst cultists who have predicted the end of the world . When it does not happen on the date foretold instead of coming to the conclusion that they were wrong, they will instead go out and become MORE fanatical about their belief. <br /><br />Of course, you can argue that the same applies to climate change believers, but their contentions are generally supported by the scientific evidence and the physical evidence around us.   Whereas your contentions fall into the 'fringe science&quot; camp as evidenced by you thinking a non scientist like Booker who believes asbestos is harmless has more credibility than a body like NASA who can hardly be accused of being a bunch of pinko green tree huggers . <br />Is this a cogent enough argument for you ?<br /> I expect your meme filled reply to be VERY predictable .</p>

	<p>Mt Coochey, What would be the point ? , any scientific evidence presented to you contrary to your beliefs is always going to be ignored by you , no matter how weighty the source. Attempts will be made to  discredit it because it comes from a so called &quot; biased' source, and red herrings and straw men will be thrown in its path . You know darn well the &quot;17 years of non warming 'which was pushed by the UK press has been debunked by the met office and many other prestigious bodies but you will still be repeating it like a record stuck in its groove many years from now. <br /><br />We cannot ever convince you that you are wrong, I wish  that we weren't messing up this wonderful planet so rapidly , pressures of pollution will force emerging industrial powers to change as this snippet illustrates &quot; With the Delhi winter causing severe temperature inversion conditions during the night - where the cold night air acts as a dome trapping in the warmer city air - the study found that real-time pollution levels soared during the night, peaking in the early morning.<br /><br />One participant in the study was Bhure Lal, chairman of the Environment Pollution Authority, who lives in the heart of the greenest part of the city known as Lutyens Delhi, where he takes his morning power walk along with the rest of the city's elite in the lush Lodhi Gardens.<br /><br />While the WHO recommended daily standard for exposure to small particles is just 60 micrograms per cubic metre, Mr Lal discovered to his horror that the air he was breathing in the Lodhi Gardens on the morning of November 13 had 1195.83 micrograms of small particles per cubic metre.<br /><br />Similar instances if extrelemy high pollution in cities in china mean that they will have clean up their acts sooner rather than later or face civil unrest by their populations</p>

	<p>Shark I note once again that you do not present a single piece of scientific evidence for me to ignore! So what exactly is your point?  We have had so much dud information - Climate Gate Amazon Gate Netherlands Gate and as for Tim Flanney it would take several pages to list them. If it were some trivial academic stoush that would be one thing but the millions spent on desalination plants could have done so much good elsewhere.</p>

	<p>My point is you have closed mind and the ability to stick to a point of view despite evidence to the contrary. BTW I did provide an example -  this was a valid scientific study conducted in Delhi by people equipped with particle sensors , can't you read ? <br />oh no of course , it doesn't support your view so it has to be wrong ....<br />I seem to remember a lot of conservatives criticising the lack of desalination plants during the drought, most greenies were against them because of their potential to pollute the oceans.<br />Of course,when we have another drought, then it will be a different matter I expect - 'why didn't we build more of them &quot; I can just imagine the murdoch press headlines ......</p>

I typically disregard EVAN's (and many others) comments because they are clearly industry funded. He's a plant....trying to look like an individual, but actually part of an organization with an agenda to corrupt.<br /><br />in this case, the organization has gone too far and this comment section is almost completely overrun by anti-science propaganda. Its an outrage!<br /><br />from what I can tell, the outcomes at Peru were not ideal, but certainly not the worst case scenario. At least there seems to be a more formal agreement on a reduced target, despite the best efforts of EVAN's employers trying to muddy waters and influence others against action.</p>

	<p>so your counter-argument is to ask for proof instead of denying it?<br /><br />doing a good job of making yourself and your band of denier brethren look like exactly what you have been accused of...<br /><br />I've got no proof. The only people who could  back me up would be hackers who would trace all of your IP's, find out the person registered to that IP at your ISP, then find out your employment details and confirm affiliations to fossil fuel agencies via bank account statements. I guess they could also crosscheck these IP's of the people on the IPA payroll, staff at the young liberal headquarters, Abbott's office, Bolts office, various online blogs like Jo Nova or one of Tom Harris's many online denier pages such as the ICSC. Asking for proof is ridiculous (but not impossible if we had fossil fuel resources). People ARE allowed to come to conclusions based off observations and opinion AND RESEARCH into known affiliations.<br /><br />My 'proof' is that knowing your opinion represents a small minority of people, somehow this small minority of people suddenly decided to post all at once of their own initiative the same bloody copy-paste propaganda as sold by your right wing media, Bolt the IPA and various heartland affiliated fossil fuel mouthpeice propaganda agencies. <br /><br />You cant even deny what I've said, just turn it around....typical public servant mentality. You know full well that I'm right and are sweating at the possibility that there may be proof. Luckily for you people, I don't have any and don't have the resources to test my hypothesis. You should be worried that maybe someone out there does though.</p>

	<p>interesting fact JC that you may find entertaining. When we google your name, several interesting pictures pop up instead. for example:<br /><br />Bolt, Abbott, Pell, Hunt, brandis. morrison, monkton, voldemort... hockstick charts, windmills and then many pictures of people suffering.<br /><br />Usually i find this kind of basic search gives some insight into affiliations...although not evidence of anything sinister, its a loose trail of where you have been.

	<p>Self-evidently, the Peru meeting happened because the governments of the world take the threat of climate change seriously.   Of course coming to a global agreement on limitation will be a difficult process in which the least well-off nations have an unusually powerful say.   <br /><br />The question here is whether or not the least cogent arguments should have an equally disproportionate say, and it appears Thomas, that yours has.   Thing is, that's the essential attribute  of this space; every view that's printable gets space.  The bigger question is; does this jumble of opinion strengthen or weaken our capacity as a nation to make wise governance decisions.<br /><br />If we are weakening our system that would make the issue of this space the most pressing of all. The truly depressing thing is that cuts at the ABC are much more likely to silence you Thomas, than is any serious consideration of the effect of rants by all of us here... or the disengagement of the vast majority (99.7%) from the political process.</p>

	<p>No, Colmery, the Peru meeting happened because half the world's governments are full of people who want to pretend they take climate change seriously while enjoying multi-million dollar junkets and the other half of the world's governments are full of rent seekers wanting the other governments to give them a magic pudding of endless money. The fact is that the Peru meeting has ended the same way that all the others did- countries promising much, but never with the intention of prioritising them over any and all other domestic considerations. When it came to making any real difference at all it was an utter failure.</p>

	<p>CO2 emissions in China have about tripled in the last 15 years. So moving to decreasing emissions in just 16 years is actually quite impressive if you have a look at graphic representations of their emissions over time you realise that their commitments are actually impressive. The other thing to consider is that they have been putting measures in place for some time to make these changes. They have secured LNG contracts with Russia and Australia which will allow them to switch from coal to gas. And they are building lots of new nuclear power stations, too. That is the issue that people here are ignoring - that making these changes takes a lot of time. <br /><br />China has been building with a plan for decades down the track, whereas we have not. It is estimated it will take us 15 years just to start a nuclear power industry, and double that before it could start to replace coal. We have to start from nothing. And we have signed long term contracts to sell all our LNG to China and Japan - greatly limiting our abilities to use gas power generation to replace coal. We have snookered ourselves between the extremes of our political spectrum - the 20% of nutters on the right who still don't believe we will have to reduce emissions, and the 10% of nutters on the left who think that we can change over to renewables in a few years time, and for whom nuclear and LNG is somehow immoral. Meanwhile the 70% of us in the middle who just want a pragmatic solution are ignored. <br /><br />Also consider that in the USA, both gas and particularly nuclear are now significantly cheaper than coal for electricity production - despite the USA having the worlds largest reserves of coal (US Dept of Energy figures from a couple of months ago). So regardless of who is in the Whitehouse in a couple of years, US emissions are going to continue to fall sharply. In fact, the Republicans have consistently said they wanted increased nuclear power production - their policy had been 40%. Now it is cheaper it is only going to increase. Those on the right of the Republicans might not agree with AGW, but they aren't going to spend extra money just to deliberately increase emissions! Mr Abbott's position is completely out of touch with reality. Our coal industry is already in the process of going broke. Feel free to invest in coal if you like - just have a talk to Mr Tinkler about the investment opportunities.</p>

	<p>@ Evan<br /><br />&quot;The funny part is when they find out the West is broke.Of course it would be in China's best interest if they could weaken the American military machine in the process.&quot;<br /><br />China owns nearly $1 trillion in U.S. Treasury debt. China wants the U.S. economy to prosper because that means China will be able to continue exporting there. As it is, exports from China to the European Union are all down. Exports to the U.S. are up. China is not in a position to threaten the U.S. with financial &quot;terrorism&quot; of any kind. A decision by China to sell off massive positions of U.S. debt would send the American economy into a downward spiral, harming not only the value of China's investments, but also China's export-driven economy.<br /></p>

	<p>&quot;China owns nearly $1 trillion in U.S. Treasury debt&quot;.<br /><br />But do remember that from Quarter 1 through to quarter 3 last year the US Federal Reserve had increased its balance sheet from $900 billion to $3.7 trillion.<br /><br />The Fed has been simply firing up the printing presses and print out of thin air over $85 billion of new money each and every month. This is money that goes directly into the money supply.<br /><br />US$ 1 trillion,.....that is really just 11 months worth of work for the printing press.</p>

	<p>The fact that a decision by China to sell off massive their holdings of US debt would send the American economy into a downward spiral is the point of China having so much US debt, Cookie. Plenty of countries have made their economy a weapon to be used against their enemies, the US during the Second World War being a good example, but China has worked out how to make the US economy a weapon to be used against the US itself. As Jonathan Swift put it They have his soul, who has his bonds. At some point the US will find itself in opposition to China in the same way that the US found itself in opposition to Britain in 1956 and China will do to the US what the US did to Britain over the Suez matter back then- force them to back down by threatening to sell their debt and crash their economy.</p>

	<p>Evan<br /><br />You are correct, as far as you go. However the one fact that is positive amongst all the political garbage is that the debate has shifted (finally) from &quot;is it real?&quot; To &quot;yes it's real, what do we do about it?&quot; <br /><br />Out national politics is snail-slow at resolving problems, and international politics is even worse. The FIRST step in any problem solving process is called 'defining the problem'. Regardless of the political cr#p displayed by the petty leaders involved! at least the ball is rolling. The snowball effect will follow, and eventually changes will happen too.</p>

	<p>I believe it is in the hands of the insurers of the Russian ship, convention is that the ship that is rescued meets the costs .<br /><br /> the global surface warming trend for 1997?2012 is approximately 0.11 to 0.12?C per decade.The carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere was about 285 parts per million in 1880, the first year in the GISS temperature record. By 1960, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, measured at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, was about 315 parts per million. This measurement peaked last year at more than 400 parts per million.<br />While the world experienced relatively warm temperatures in 2013, the continental United States experienced the 42nd warmest year on record, according to GISS analysis. For some other countries, such as Australia, 2013 was the hottest year on record.<br />The temperature analysis produced at GISS is compiled from weather data from more than 1,000 meteorological stations around the world, satellite observations of sea-surface temperature, and Antarctic research station measurements, taking into account station history and urban heat island effects. Software is used to calculate the difference between surface temperature in a given month and the average temperature for the same place from 1951 to 1980. This three-decade period functions as a baseline for the analysis. It has been 38 years since the recording of a year of cooler than average temperatures.<br />The GISS temperature record is one of several global temperature analyses, along with those produced by the Met Office Hadley Centre in the United Kingdom and NOAA's National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C. These three primary records use slightly different methods, but overall, their trends show close agreement.</p>

	<p>The problem is EVAN that not everyone thinks in the manner you do. Not everyone is in it for the money, or to look good, or to appease their consciences. <br /><br />Generally people look at evidence. Once they have assessed that evidence they act on it. It seems the world in general can see there is a problem and are now deciding how to tackle it. unfortunately internation diplomacy takes time.<br /><br />It also seems that the Chinese dont really like breathing in the muck seen year round in Beijing. Unlike most other nations, China thinks long term (I suggest you read Odd Westad's excellent 'Restless Empire'), and can see not only the climatic benefit of action but also the long term economic benefit.<br /></p>

	<p>There are issues with nuclear waste, but I can't see that this is any different to other forms of energy generation. Solar power for example produces thousands of times more toxic waste per energy unit produced than nuclear, and it lasts even longer and has permanently contaminated large parts of China. However, because this waste occurs at the site of manufacture (in China) we tend to forget about it. But it is already killing people, none the less. The chemical products of solar generation are estimated to kill far more people than nuclear.  And bizarrely, radiation from power generation from coal is estimated to have killed far, far more people than due to nuclear power generation! <br /><br />There are actually figures calculated for deaths per trillion kW produced. Obviously, coal loses. Coal is estimated to kill about 200 000 a year in China alone! But kills people here every year, too. Nuclear and wind have the lowest associated risk. Solar isn't too bad, but is about 5x more deaths per power unit generated than nuclear and about 3x higher than wind.<br /><br />There is a particular paranoia that exists around radioactivity that simply doesn't exist with chemical waste.</p>

	<p>You are correct HNW. Radioactivity associated with coal burning is calculated to cause more cancer deaths than from the nuclear industry, but less than from radon, cosmic rays  and other natural radiation exposures. <br /><br />As for burying nuclear waste people ignore the fact that the stuff that is being dug up is already radioactive. And its been down there for millions of years. Burying nuclear waste for a few million years in a geologically stable place like Australia is cheap and reliable.</p>

	<p>Storing nuclear waste should not be viewed as a problem, but rather as an opportunity. Technology will allow the waste to be refined and re processed, probably many times over.

	<p>Oh Hairy Nosed One, China moving to decreasing emissions in just 16 years might indeed be impressive but, of course, that is NOT what she has stated she would do. China said that she would continue to increase emissions UNTIL 2030, at which point she would think about maybe doing something to sort of level emissions out, if that was appropriate at the time. They want to improve particulate matter pollution but that is nothing to do with so-called greenhouse gas emissions. I, for one, would be happy if Australia were to match China's commitment. At least you seem prepared to consider nuclear, which should mean you are demonised by the watermelons.</p>

	<p>Roger: &quot;I, for one, would be happy if Australia were to match China's commitment.&quot;<br /><br />I am extremely glad to hear that. China has committed to obtain as much energy from renewable sources as the US current generates in total by the year 2030 or earlier (i.e. 800GW). Australia would have to obtain around 40GW from renewables to match their commitment.</p>

	<p>Also China has plans for several new hydro electric schemes.<br />Unfortunately my understanding is that the Aust Greens oppose (a) nuclear power plants in Aust; (b) any new hydro electric schemes and possibly (c) oppose fracking in Aust, too late to stop in QLD but NSW having all sorts of problems.<br />While the above options remain politically difficult in Aust coal will continue to have a place in Aust energy mix.</p>

	<p>Actually there are no real hydro schemes left to oppose unless people wanted to revisit the Lower Franklin (previously known as the Gordon Splits) there aren't really any sights left. This is wear the alarmists use a slight of hand when comparing Australian renewables with NZ Norway and Sweden. Those countries are virtually built for hydro power.  I have even seen it asserted that Norway does not use its massive coal reserves but neglect to mention these reserves are under fifty fathoms of the North Sea.</p>

	<p>@ Realist1<br /><br />When will you get it - just saying it doesn't make it true.<br /><br />There is a REASON that scientists form a consensus about things. The reason is because of the EVIDENCE. Would you dispute any other scientific consensus and label it as &quot;not scientific&quot;? How about the scientific consensus that the earth orbits of the sun? How about the scientific consensus that biological evolution explains the biological diversity on this planet. How about the scientific consensus that a water molecule consists of one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms?<br /><br />If you want to be taken seriously when you dispute ANY SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS, you better have a really, really good argument backed up with lots of really, really good evidence that can withstand the expert scrutiny of the peer-review process. If you don't or can't, then when you dispute mainstream established science, I for one am not going to take you particularly seriously.<br /></p>

	<p>@ Thomas<br /><br />&quot;Not long ago Chine told the USA that they would continue their rapid increase their CO2 emission for at least further 16 years. However, the AGW propaganda machine tried to spin that as a &quot;great achievement&quot;.&quot;<br /><br />The industrial revolution had a great effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions starting in the United Kingdom, followed by Europe, North America, and eventually the world. The industrial revolution marks a major turning point in human history. Starting in the later part of the eighteenth century, Great Britain's previously manual labour and animal-based economy changed to machine-based manufacturing. It started with the mechanization of the textile industries followed by development of iron-making techniques which lead to increased use of coal. The developments of machine tools in the first two decades of the nineteenth century led to manufacturing of more machines for other industries. The first industrial revolution, which began in the eighteenth century led to Second industrial revolution in nineteenth century, with the development of steam-powered ships and railways. Nineteenth century witnessed internal combustion engine and electrical power generation. With industrial revolution came a series of environmental impacts - air pollution, water pollution, thermal pollution, noise pollution and degradation of forest and other ecosystems. Increase in carbon dioxide led to global warming due to greenhouse effect.<br /><br />Industrialized countries have accumulated 'historical' emissions in the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution.<br /><br />....<br /><br />Not long ago, in 1977, the total amount of energy used in all over China (pop. 950 million) was equal to the total amount of energy used only for air-conditioning homes and offices in the United States (pop. 220 million).<br /><br />Back in those days millions of Chinese used to commute on bicycles. Today you can hardly see a bicycle at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. <br /><br />Who is going to tell Chinese that they mustn't be driving cars and they mustn't be using fossil fuel to turn Australian iron-ore into steel? <br /></p>

What they actually agreed to was to reduce their carbon emissions growth rate to zero by 2030. <br /><br />It takes a a lot of money and effort to turn an economy and population as big as China's around. But china has been making this effort for over 5 years. to replace new power stations that use coal with solar and wind farms, nuclear will likely be in the mix, is a huge task. Do you think they could do this overnight?<br /><br />Moreover the chinese have several carbon pricing mechanisms in place to fund the transition.<br /><br />What do we now have? Direct Action - paying huge multinational companies a massive amount of money to invest in the transition they were once forced to employ at their own cost.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>You seem to have conflated the science of anthropogenic global warming (and the associated climate change) with the actions of the worlds leaders in attempting to address this issue.<br /><br />What the world's political leaders say or don't say or do or don't do is completely separate on what the actual scientific evidence reveals. On that point, the scientific consensus is that the evidence clearly shows that human activity is contributing significantly to the warming of the planet which is causing the sea level to rise and the climate to change.<br /></p>

	<p>Sorry but if this is a detailed analysis of the outcomes, then what a pathetic article. Just really a piece of ideology really. Sop there is no legally binding agreement, it is all voluntary, there is no requirement to open up for detailed inspection of actual reductions.

	<p>@ Realist1<br /><br />&quot;Its only lies when its not what you want to hear&quot;<br /><br />You've nearly got the quote from George Castanza right, but anyway. No, it is a lie when it is clearly and obviously different than what the mainstream scientific opinion is. The IPCC report summaries the scientific views on this topic. Predictions of sea level rise by 2100 vary from about 50cm (most optimistic) to 150 cm (most pessimistic). A 1 metre rise by 2100 is right in the middle. To suggest that the science predicts it will take 800 years, when the science so clearly says about 85 years, qualifies in my books as a lie.<br /><br />LOL! So, I'm the science denier? Really? I accept the mainstream peer-reviewed science and you don't, but yet I'm the science denier? Amazing. Well I got no come-back to that one - I guess that means you win. Congratulations.<br /></p>

	<p>That's a cherrypick Realist1. Sea level rise is not consistent over the globe. It has risen higher than average in Tuvalu and other places, Florida for instance. Sea levels are rising, and rising faster after being very static for several thousand years.<br /><br />Talking about one tide gauge does not make a persuasive argument.</p>

	<p>Gregory, have you the foggiest idea how many billions of your money is spent every year `securing our borders`  so the LNP and the ALP can compete for the bogan vote?  The highest influx of refugees has never never exceeded  2.5%  of our annual immigration intake, but demonising and punishing  `illegals` is worth the ridiculous expense,  your money Gregory, because the redneck vote matters.  <br /><br />Find something more important to care about and let your local member know.</p>

	<p>give instances please? i live near the sea but i am 15 metres above sea level . However it could easily be claimed that I believe that eventually we will have sea levels rise and my buying a house near the sea is a sign of hypocrisy on my part. So we can verify the accuracy of your statement i would like the details of all the climate activists who have bought waterfront properties that are less than two metres or so above present sea level or which are in flood prone areas . I wait with bated breath for receipt of your confirming post.</p>

	<p>Trekka clearly doesn't understand how China works at all. China makes serious long-term strategic decisions (hence buying food supplies from around the planet (for some reason in Australia we're calling it a trade agreement; they don't): no eggs in one basket for them). <br /><br />China will achieve its 2030 target long before 2030 (a pattern it has done with other targets), ramp up the target and keep going. They know this is an economic opportunity not a cost. If only we did.</p>

	<p>i would say the outcome was a complete fail when it comes to the realists in this nation with hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars being pledged by the liberal party to waste on an issue we have not caused, have no real impact upon (australia co2 emissions equate to 1.3% according to the united nations) and will not have any impact upon solving.<br /><br />another failure of the two party duopoly.  it is long past time our governments called referendums/plebiscites on how these issues should be dealt with.  i have far more faith in the average aussie than i do in the packs of failed lawyers, businesspeople and union hacks who have control over this nations political systems.</p>

	<p>@dbtm, you are absolutely correct. Peter of Melbourne is simply projecting. <br />Personally I didnt put up solar panels to appease my ego. It simply made economic sense. There are many other things I do reduce my carbon footprint, or just try and live a little greener. Usually it has the benefit of also being economically beneficial. Weird that huh?<br />Im also unsure as how what some Greenpeace activists do or dont do relates to their egos? I know who Clive Palmer is, Twiggy and Gina too... Cant name any Greenpeace activists. If its about egos their not doing a great job of making a name for themselves to feed those egos are they?<br />Oh, considering I will most likely be dead before we see any reversal of the damage we humans are doing to this planet, and it may hopefully be my children or grandchildren who will benefit, I cant see how any of my actions have anything to do with my ego??</p>

	<p>Blah, Blah, Blah. Historic reality tells us the planet is coolish today, 2C would put it back in the sweet spot where humanity really prospers, 3-4C would be better. What we do is irrelevant the planet is going through it's natural cycles and we are beginning to experience a period of great prosperity. Crop yields are increasing, global vegetation coverage is increasing despite deforestation. A warmer planet is more hospitable for humans than the cool conditions we have endured for much of the past 2000 years. We should make the most of it because the next ice age is only millennia away.</p>

	<p>Neil.<br /><br />I see you not only can't read well but are struggling with some of the science despite it being rather simple.<br /><br />I will try to help you.<br /><br />I mentioned the &quot;observed accelerated rate of climate change&quot;. Clearly this is too complex a phrase.... I will try to make it easier for you. You also erroneously suggest that we are just experiencing a &quot;natural cycle&quot;.<br /><br />I suggest you begin by learning about this concept called &quot;cause and effect&quot;.<br /><br />The scientists have observed that the climate changes in response to various things like the eccentricity of the Earths orbit (a 100,000 year cycle), the tilt of the Earths axis (a 41,000 year cycle) and its precession (a 19,000 - 24,000 cycle), amongst other things. However the current position of Earth in these cycles would mean our planet should not be warming, yet it is. Hence they are able to determine the natural cycles are not the cause of the effect seen.<br /><br />Scientists have also noted that the rate of change has not been observed previously in Earths 4.5 billion year history (extinction level events like asteroid/comet impacts excepted).<br /><br />Scientists have been able to determine that the cause of the effect (abnormal accelerated rate of climate change in the wrong direction) is the increase in greenhouse gases resulting from human industrialisation.<br /><br />Crop yields are increasing not because of increases in greenhouse gases but because of superior farming techniques, ie. the cause of the effect is better farming techniques.<br /><br />Crops also need water, but as the climate continues to warm the extremes occur more regularly and the extremes become more extreme (ie. the effect is a result of climatic changes), the planet is becoming drier and as the parts of the planet that need the water most are becoming drier more quickly.<br /><br />There have been some excellent example of these extremes bought on by changes to the ocean temperature which impact on the jet streams, and as the jet streams have become more wobbly they have caused extreme conditions to become more extreme (and more regularly).<br /><br />Note too that another effect of greenhouse gases is that the oceans become more acidic. This increase in acidity threatens the existence of marine organisms that produce over 50% of the planets oxygen. <br /><br />Cause and effect......<br /><br />Learn about it some day.</p>

	<p>With the drop in commodity prices our national income is dropping.  Tsk tsk.  As if it wasn't obvious as far back as 2009 that China was starting to stockpile iron ore so that it could drive the price down by reducing immediate demand.  <br /><br />Now our treasurer is bemoaning this drop in income as causing budgetary pain.  Oh diddums.  It doesn't matter whether the price of ore goes up or down, it's always going to fluctuate.  So fools the LNP for hitching their wagon to this rather tottering nag.  <br /><br />More fools they for removing  the carbon price.  And pouring gazillions of bucks into the &quot;Direct Action&quot; farce.  So not only have they removed a steady source of income (the fossil fuel industry isn't going to stop polluting any time soon) but they've opened what will turn out to be an unclosable stopcock of subsidies to the fossilites.<br /><br />Why not re-instate the carbon price scheme?  For once it wouldn't be breaking a promise - &quot;No new taxes&quot;  - (a) it was never a tax (though it was income) and (b) it wouldn't be new.</p>

	<p>Have you forgotten Abbott's promise to get rid of the carbon tax, greenspider? He was saying it every time he even suspected a camera was present. He must have been saying it in his sleep. Not only would it be a broken promise, but it is one that he does not want to break.</p>

	<p>&quot;but it is one that he does not want to break.&quot;<br /><br />It seems he kept his promise.  It can't be broken.<br /><br />I don't ever recalling him promising not to bring it back though.<br /><br />In February 11th's Australian Business Spectator the following is reported:<br /><br />&quot;Environment Minister Greg Hunt said the carbon tax was an attack on the entire Australian economy.<br /><br />&quot;Despite a $7.6 billion tax, emissions for the first 12 months barely changed by 0.1 per cent,&quot; he said.&quot;<br /><br />If you add on the roughly $2 billion to be spent on &quot;direct action&quot;  there's a $9 billion loss directly attributable to this government's policies.<br /><br />The problem our Joe is struggling with now is the size of the budget deficit, not the carbon  emissions.<br /></p>

	<p>&quot;'greenspider' you obviously live in your 'greenspider fairyland&quot;<br /><br />Yes, I do Thomas.  And it's a great place to be.  By dint of ethical investment (ie &quot;green&quot;) going back to the late 1970s, my fairly land has no bills - ie I paid cash for my house, I've been able to virtually move off the electric grid from my investment, I've paid $50,000 capital gains tax to cover any government &quot;subsidies&quot;, I've got a water consumption bill of about $5.00 a month and generally speaking the old age pension is quite adequate for my meagre needs.<br /><br />For entertainment I can read and listen to the grizzling of people such as yourself who are unable to see their noses in front of their faces and realise there's a huge financial return in being green.</p>

	<p>Thomas, it is amazing that people deny the possibility that there is AGW at all.<br /><br />What such people have to prove is that the emission of millions of tonnes CO2 into the atmosphere has no effects at all. Or, they say, yes there is heating but it doesn't matter; all we need to do is adapt and enjoy the increase in plant food.<br /><br />Of course, such a position ignores the deleterious effects of rising temperatures.<br /><br />There are those here who claim there has been no heating at all for 16 years. Such people when they see water boiling at 100 degree C will claim there is no heating happening here; or they will know how the heat goes in the steam - but they will not allow that the heat coming to the Earth is in fact raising temperatures on land (15 out of the past 16 are hottest ever) but also melting ice and warming the oceans.<br /><br />The loss of ice is measurable. Eggleton tells us (&quot;Climate Change&quot;, CUP 2013, page 103): &quot;In 2011, the total amount of ice lost to Antarctica and Greenland was measured (&quot;Geophysical research Letters 38, LO5503). The rate at which ice was melting...was accelerating by about 36 cubic kilometres a year annually, so that the the 2011 loss amounted to some 600 cubic kilometres...&quot;<br /><br />That took a large amount of heat. The notion that the sun stopped shining in 1998 is ridiculous.  <br /><br />As for heating: &quot;At present the world is warming at the rate of 1 degree C in 60 years, 20 times faster than any previous sustained rate of temperature change.&quot; (Eggleton, p133).</p>

	<p>obviously much more is achieved by meeting in person, especially with such an important topic. You want to weaken and reduce the outcomes by these meetings by any means possible right?<br /><br />The cost of all of this flying around keeps being mentioned but did any of you stop to think that the short term cost is an investment in ensuring that an agreement is made?<br /><br />So what if their carbon footprint is large at the moment. Once again the deniers miss the point. Its about a LONG TERM investment to make changes in the long run which will have far more impact. Most of you don't even understand or cannot comprehend the basic point I'm making. Its a lack of comprehension of scale - all you see is what is immediately in front of you. To the rest of us, your argument just seems ridiculous, but you would call it &quot;logic&quot;<br /><br />when all of the difficult groundwork is done, I'm sure teleconferences will do the job down the track.</p>

	<p>&quot;The real achievement of the Peru climate talks&quot;. Says it all really. If we need telling what the &quot;real&quot; achievement was, then it certainly wasn't what was intended. Although Christian Downie thinks it is becoming &quot;increasingly hard for breakaway countries to ignore the issue&quot;, that clearly hasn't stopped them saying &quot;no&quot;. An initial dozen-page draft final text had by the second week of the conference ballooned to more than 50 pages as countries added their rival submissions, while not a single paragraph was actually agreed by the end of the scheduled conference. Real achievement?<br /><br />That then leads to the obvious question, was it all worth it? Christian Downie thinks so because of what he consoles himself is the &quot;real&quot; achievement. In terms of climate change, what Downie hasn't told us is that the conference in Lima wasn't a very good template for how the rest of us should behave. The conference, of course, was reliant on fossil fuels in diesel generators. Organisers rejected powering the conference village with solar panels on the grounds they were too unreliable, while efforts to hook the site up to the national grid, which has a significant renewable (hydro) energy component, failed due to technical problems. <br /><br />It is believed that the Lima talks may have had the biggest carbon footprint of any UN conference to date at more than 50,000 tons of carbon dioxide. As well as the diesel generators, the footprint was enlarged by the jet fuel burned by the estimated 11,000 people who flew in from abroad to attend, including roughly 4,000 from non-governmental organisations, as well as the emissions from the fleet of coaches that crawled through Lima?s gridlocked streets to shuttle delegates to and from the venue. What was that about the &quot;real achievement&quot; again?<br /><br />Finally it is worth considering John Kerry's comments. It is of course easy to lecture others when there is no chance of having to implement the proposals you are putting up. There is zero chance of the US going down the path that President Obama outlined in Brisbane; the US mid-term elections saw to that. Americans voted for the Republicans in Congress and the Senate, so Kerry can say what he likes, but he can't actually do anything about it. All in all, not a very promising picture for the Paris conference next year. Probably the best that could come from that would be for the conference attendees to live by their values for once and hold it on-line instead.</p>

	<p>Out comes all the delusional climate change deniers.<br />The only lunacy I haven't read here &quot;yet&quot; is we've had no rise in temperature for the last 18 years.<br />Each decade in Australia has been getting hotter.<br />Climate change is savaging the northern hemisphere with ice and snow storms throughout the winter months, then followed by droughts, then floods. That's thanks to the melting of the Arctic ice.<br />IF you can prove that climate change and global warming is an absolute hoax, then provide your peer-reviewed research and claim the Nobel Prize. (and the $100,000 reward that is offered if you can absolutely prove the scientists wrong!)<br /></p>

	<p>Nice try, but the way proper science works is that the one posing the hypothesis has to demonstrate the validity of the claim with irrefutable proof.<br /><br />So over to you to put up the irrefutable proof that manmade CO2 emissions cause catastrophic climate change.<br /><br />(Remembering always of course that correlation is NOT causation).</p>

	<p>Firstly, MOTH, nothing in science can ever be proven beyond doubt.<br /><br />And as for your &quot;correlation doesn't prove causation,&quot; true (and if I remember the tobacco industry used that one for years after a correlation between smoking and cancer was identified).  Fortunately, we also have a mechanism which was established before anyone observed the correlation.<br /><br />So, for AGW, we have a correlation, and we have a mechanism.  We also have a heap of data from farming, ecological destruction, and paleontological climate change which tells us that we should probably be worried about the magnitude and rate of plausible change. <br /><br />If you want to refute this conclusion, the onus is now on you to provide evidence.  Good luck with that, nobody has done so successfully yet (at least, not in a way which survives scientific scrutiny).</p>

	<p>&quot;But this is the key; international talks like the ones held this week increase the pressure on governments to act.&quot;<br /><br />The pressure is only on those developed countries that have to foot the bill for supposed climate guilt the rest just have to carry on with business as usual and with a bit of luck get some easy money in the process.<br /><br />Lets see what the Americans take to Paris next year after the Republicans get hold of it.</p>

	<p>While I am skeptical of what these meetings achieve I guess that is the best we have in terms of dealing with multilateral issues as complex as this. The best we can hope for is to drive momentum on reducing pollution which eventually carries all nations along. <br /><br />I note that as the science of climate change and how dangerous becomes more settled (I talk in particular about the relationship between human inputs and uncertain climate outputs) the idealogues are becoming more and more shrill. Just reading some of the serial posters here is a treat. They are falling into a smaller and smaller minority and shouting louder. <br /><br />Really quite funny.</p>

	<p>This article and too many of the comments being made about it show up much of the real problem.  i.e. an article that points out the political deficiencies in a global forum trying to get consensus and then the myriad of comments indicating that is a good reason for not bothering to do anythng themselves about the actual problem under discussion. Its like saying that because our nations police forces have not succeeded in combating drugs, there is therefore nothing wrong about it so therefore we might as well all go and use drugs.</p>

	<p>Real achievements were the environmental movement so concerned about reef destruction for instance in Australia damaged the Nazca Lines in Peru.  Leading by example Greenpeace as usual. Greenpeace no doubt flew their activists on planes to Peru to protest about carbon emissions. No hyprocrisy there. Let's hope the Peruvians stop them leaving and charge them  with the damage which apparently could be a sentence of up to six years imprisonment. That will do more to reduce carbon emissions as globe trotting activists sit in gaol than the whole conference achieved. The conference is expected to have the biggest carbon footprint of any UN conference, with components for temporary structures flown in, concrete laid and diesel generators used to provide electricity. That is a real source of achievement 50 000 tonnes of carbon emitted to hold the conference that those concerned for the planet emitted to hold their meeting. We are constantly told we must reduce our emissions by those concerned for the planet yet for some reason they seem to be the ones who fly overseas on conferences and holidays at the drop of a hat with seemingly no care. Good on them I say because it shows their true concern, zero. So we all know the whole thing is a scam because even those spruiking their doom and gloom don't believe it which is evident by their actions.</p>

	<p>We are at the point of no return already according to many an expert. A world leading authority on polar regions Professor Wadhams from Cambridge University stated that the Arctic  will be ice free by 2015,  which he then amended to no later then September 2016  and now has amended to 2020. So by 2020 the Arctic will be ice free according to a climate expert, unless the date mysteriously changes again.</p>

	<p>I've actually complained to the ABC about a couple of posters when I have followed up papers and found deliberate and demonstrable lies.  (Not often, it's usually hard to &quot;prove&quot; that they're lying, but on a couple of occasions, papers were deliberately and cynically misrepresented in a manner for which there was no defense.)  I gave up when nothing was done, and the same liars kept getting their BS published.  The ABC is supposed to have a code of conduct, but this doesn't seem to be enforced.</p>

	<p>Perhaps, given how impossible the right wing has become on this issue, we should deal with it like a long term bet - about 25-50 years should be fine for that.<br /><br />All those who support action to limit greenhouse gas emissions should pay for it and those who don't should not have to... however... when there comes a time when it's no longer even vaguely plausible for the right wing to ignore the ever increasing evidence of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions then we essentially bar all those who made that choice from politics and from voting as they've proven themselves utterly incapable of making sensible decisions based on scientific evidence that ranges from basic physics and atmospheric chemistry through to biology (which overwhelmingly demonstrates climate change is happening due to unprecedented changes in migration patterns, habitation ranges, mating seasons, etc) to the physical effect on satellites (which have had to adjust their orbital speed due to a cold induced condensation of the upper atmosphere - exactly as greenhouse gas induced warming predicts since heat is trapped close to the surface of the planet rather than re-radiated back into space). <br /><br />Deal? You guys get the next few decades to whoop it up while the left and anyone else with a functional knowledge of science pay more and then we're rid of your terrible decision making for ever.</p>

	<p>Great Idea Bazza. I bet most of them actually contribute very little the economy anyway - its about perpetuating an image that they are somehow important high income earners, burnt by all of those nasty scientific people and funding the beach lifestyle of all the &quot;leaners&quot;<br /><br />Sure, let them not pay anything. The problem is when the bet ends in 25-30 years, very few will be around to actually pay up!<br /><br />I think you are onto something though. If it means they shut up with their anti-science propaganda, then sure, excuse them from paying anything. If they want to be selfish and put the renewable share performance ahead of the future then let them so do. Its the real 'lifters' who are doing something about Co2/ pollution anyway.<br /><br />PS: how obvious is it that this thread has been swamped in an organised way by the same group of deniers as always. Every single post seems to be anti-science BS....I thought it may have been another link from Jo Nova's page, but there was nothing there. There must be another blog around where these people are quite active in denying AGW.</p>

	<p>If any of those with a functional knowledge of climate science could actually make a prediction that actually eventuated they might be believed. Unfortunately from millions of climate refugees, ice free poles, no snow in the UK and flooding all over the planet they just can't get it right. When they had heavy snow falls in the UK for instance which wasn't supposed to happen because of global warming, sorry climate change they blamed it on .... climate change. Perhaps we should stop everyone who believes in climate change from voting as they are so gullible and believe anything that they are told.</p>

	<p>Is it just me, or does it seem that the denialist brigade are just a bit agitated and very, very quick to reply to any objective analysis of how we are responding to climate change, particularly on the ABC - Have Your Say pages.  I have this vision of coal and old industry mercenaries (paid up or Lord Monkton groupies) slavishly waiting for the next environmental opinion piece on the ABC.  I guess our version of democracy allows the mercenaries to say their piece too, but I wish those reasoned and objective thinkers would respond as eloquently as they always seem to.  <br /><br />I believe scientists, not mercenaries.  <br /><br />Bit rich that the denialists are having a swipe at how much climate talks might cost, all while the fossil fuel industry are cleaning up at the expense of both our current and future livelihoods.</p>

	<p>&quot;Not these scientists I guess.&quot;<br /><br />First, very few of the people in your list are climate scientists. <br />Second, some of them ACCEPT anthropogenic climate change.<br />Third, some of them have had serious errors discovered in their work.<br />Fourth, no one has ever claimed that the scientific consensus is unanimous. Peer reviewed studies have determined about 2-3% of climate scientists do not accept the current scientific consensus.<br /><br />Also, for every scientist who name who actively disputes climate science, I'll could name you a scientist who believes the earth is 6,000 years old. Being able to name some scientific fringe dwellers does nothing to weaken the consensus.</p>

	<p>There are approximately 150K members of the American Chemical Society alone.  If we project the 97% acceptance rate of AGW amongst scientists to the ACS members, that leaves 4500 skeptics or deniers - and that's just amongst chemists in the USA (although the 150K probably includes student memberships and industrial chemists who are not actively involved in research).<br /><br />And you have...what?  Twenty-three names?  Many of whom have trashed their credibility in the process of denying AGW?  None of them notable, in my opinion; most of them I wouldn't even have heard of, had they not made loud and inaccurate noises about AGW that get trumpeted and repeated by fools who choose only to believe in what they find convenient.<br /><br />Thanks for demonstrating the usual skeptic/denier total lack of grasp of statistical analysis, BTW.</p>

	<p>olly, because it is a stupid question that only someone who completely rejects science would ask.<br /><br />If you ask that question it means you have rejected all of the freely available scientific data easily found via google. It means you reject the scientific consensus and deny logic. It means your views have been swayed by corrupt fossil fuel funded orginisations (you may not even realise it) or you may well be part of these propaganda groups.<br /><br />If you honestly (I doubt you do) want a simple summary, aimed at informing the lowest common denominator, look at what NASA says. I would start questioning the lovely charts provided to you by well dressed, respectable sounding people with slicked back hair and convincing slogans - they are snake oil merchants and many work for fossil fuel companies.</p>

	<p>Olly, one source of information is Tony Eggleton. His book on Climate Change tells us (p. 133) that &quot;At present the world is warming at the rate of 1 degree C in 60 years; that is, 20 times faster than any previous sustained rate of temperature change.&quot;<br /><br />What does your favorite Climate Change scientist tell you is the reason for such a rate of increase in temperature?<br /><br />What does your source of information tell you about the influence of the burning of fossil fuels, so that the concentration of CO2 has gone from 280 ppm to 400 ppm in about 200 years (now the highest level in at least 24 million years - Eggleton, p. 177)?<br /><br />What do you understand by the Greenhouse Effect?<br /><br />Facts please, Olly, and not just opinions.</p>

	<p>Well, the greenhouse gas mechanism is a convoluted one if you don't have university-level physics or chemistry behind you, but one which was established in 1896 by Svante Arrhenius (later won the Nobel prize, and one of the pioneers in statistical thermodynamics, on which AGW theory is based).  If you do a search on his name, you'll come across the first paper predicting that changes in CO2 levels will result in changes in global temperature.  <br /><br />As for CO2 rises (which are expected to cause temperature rises)...well, do you refute that digging up and burning fossil fuels that were deposited over hundreds of millions of years at a rate that far outpaces their formation is likely to lead to a net increase in CO2?</p>

	<p>High time to introduce a carbon tax.<br /><br />Rabid Right ideologues should welcome carbon pricing.  Pricing carbon emissions is intended to use the invisible hand of the price mechanism to gradually lessen our dependence upon fossil fuels by subsidising the increased energy costs of households and ?fairly? compensating industry, while protecting our competitiveness and productivity, at least according to such as Rio Tinto.  <br /><br />Carbon prices must rise steeply in the future once transitional support falls away, if the expectations regarding a carbon price are to lead to emission-minimising behaviour.  So while an initially low carbon price, complete with generous offsets, makes eminent political sense, an ultimate carbon price of well above $50/tonne is required to seriously drive the move towards cleaner alternatives.<br /><br />Ideologues at the IPA demand that Australia not put in place a carbon tax, because doing so unilaterally would be economically damaging and nobody is going to follow if Australia leads on such a matter.  But the shirt-fronting of Abbott by China and the U.S. before the G20 shows that we are now the followers.  Also such as Tim Wilson argue that Australia should take the lead in unilaterally reducing tariffs, thus exposing industries to even greater foreign competition despite great global economic uncertainty.<br /><br />For the bulk of the economy a carbon price would have only minor impacts on costs and competitiveness - smaller than other factors such as exchange rates, labour market costs and fuel prices.  And so it proved - but don't expect  denialists to cheer.<br /></p>

	<p>I am in fact entirely serious.  It was in fact a highly sensible and effective preliminary to more significant action.   <br /><br />Abbott's media-promoted demonising of Julia Gillard's Great Big New (Carbon) Tax has been demonstrated to be one of the most brazenly dishonest campaigns in recent political history.  <br /><br />Forcing continuation of Gillard Labor's GREAT BIG NEW CARBON TAX while dumping Abbott?s $? billion Emissions Reduction Fund (Direct Action after the Budget cuts) could have CUT the forecast deficit by as much as $19 BILLION, according to Ross Garnaut. <br />Julia got it right after all. Her supposed breach of promise promised to save Australian taxpayers the $19 BILLION that Abbott wants to waste. That's the kind of ?breach of promise? we should have more of.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>Not much point in guessing Forrest. Many important food plants and almost half of all grasses will not grow faster with increased CO2, that is their genetics. I have posted several times some of the reasons why the negatives far outweigh the positives, which IS explained in the IPCC reports. Here are a few less technical ones this time.<br /><br />Soils in Siberia and frozen Canada that may become usable are very infertile. Furthermore, these lands will still receive only limited sunlight due to the tilt of the Earth (photosynthesis requires sunlight). Severe weather events (storms, droughts) wreck crops. Protein yields will decline. <br /><br />Wetter in the tropics, dryer and hotter in the temperate zones (which is where most of the worlds food is produced). Dryer =lower soil moisture. Hotter=more transpiration and evaporation=lower soil moisture=lower yield/crop failure.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>So an increase of 62 parts per MILLION.   Strangely to me that seems a very minor % variation.   Combine that with the effect of more, or less cloud, what does it really mean?   I think they are only scratching at the surface of the complexity of climate and nobody knows.  We don't know about underwater heat variations, we don't really know the variations of the suns energy, the energy levels of the earths core itself etc.  Does CO2 lead warming or is as a result of warming?  The first thing we could do to help the environment and reduce emissions is to ban pets.</p>

	<p>Good to see that the denialist talking points have been posted out. Someone care to provide evidence for your nice round 50,000 tonnes of CO2?<br />Just in passing, I do agree with one tiny corner of your world-view: Greenpeace are masters of propaganda and need to be taken with several grains of salt. This does not mean that they do not raise valid points, just that the message gets lost in the zealotry, just as it does in, for instance, John Coochey's posts.</p>

	<p>It seems like a global consensus on CO2 mitigation  will require perseverance, and it will be a long uphill struggle as long as recalcitrant polluter nations keep playing word games and hedging their bets.<br />Despite that Lima could be considered a triumph when compared to the disaster in Copenhagen, progress has been made. <br /></p>

	<p>&quot;just imagine the next bushfire season being worse than the last, until in 30 years from now loss of lives and homes seems an almost annual event.&quot;<br /><br />I hate to be the one to tell you, Christian, but they already are, and always have, always will, and whether it's 2? or 3? or 4? hotter or cooler doesn't stop a fire from starting when it gets started.  Right now it's 22?C in Perth and yesterday there was a bushfire up near Caversham, and bushfires have nothing to do with climate change.  If you stop telling fancy stories, you might get some cred' every now and then.<br /><br />What you storytellers have to admit is that it is THE CAR that is the cause of most of the CARbon monoxide, as well as the pollution and consequent lung cancers and other illnii you try to blame on other causes.  That's the truth, but there's no money in it is there?    <br /><br />I'll be back when I finish reading your story, but you gotta stop telling porkies like that bushfire story, because it's wrong, and it makes fun of a very dangerous thing - don't play with fire, son.</p>

	<p>Same old same old - AGW is real - no its not- yes it is ...blah blah blah.<br />Can we substitute &quot;AGW&quot; for &quot;Man-made pollution&quot; and agree that exists?<br />If we can do that, is it worthwhile considering a &quot;plastic tax&quot;, or tarriff or levy? Literally tax the importation/production of plastics. It would generate an incredible amount of revenue, and force people and companies to be serious about our &quot;throw away&quot; society. Afterall, we only have whats already there, and we just don't value it highly enough. <br /> Provide an  incentive for organic food producers, and encourage the sustainable use of the land, and water. Feed the people with chemical free food, without plastic contamination of the process ( packing, marketing etc), and watch the nations health improve.<br /> Tax sugar laden food, tax chemical laden food in the same spirit as the tobacco money grab and its a dual benefit - raises much need revenue and improves health costs as well.<br /><br />Maybe we could even decide that arable land, and uncontaminated water are the most valuable assets we possess, and take steps to ensure they have long term protections - not at the whim of the politician of the day (Newman/Seeney).<br />Cheers.</p>

	<p>Tis true should have been called Man-made pollution not AGW, but than if it was called MMP, would it have supported so many non-productive people? <br />Perhaps if it had been called MMP there would have been constructive solutions offered rather than rhetoric.</p>

	<p>&quot;If you are a big developed nation and you do not lead, you are part of the problem.&quot;<br /><br />If you want to cut 25% in the next 10 years, USA, you need to lose 60 million internal combustion engines.  It's a shame that Californians are addicted to cruisin' but luckily we all know how to deal with addictions to legal things.  Just tax gasoline like we tax tobacco here Downunder, and that'll get them off the stuff.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_vehicles_in_the_United_States</p>

	<p>It's the lyfestiles of the rich and famous like in the movies.  Everyone wants to be a movie star just like hollywood.  Again, like the nazis did to the movies with smoking, banning scenes with heroes smoking cigarettes, we need those nazis to get back to hollywood and ban movie stars from being depicted doing anything involving automobiles  (except Teslas of course).  They must also outlaw all hollywood movies ever made which have involved the use or most damagingly, the admiration of motor vehicles.  That includes about 99% of all movies I ever seen, hey buddy?<br /><br />As well as 'fixing' the movies, banning all motor vehicle advertising (like tobacco advertising) across the globe is imperative.  <br /><br />Every registered vehicle must be painted olive brown with images of road carnage and global warming (use a bushfire they can't tell the truth anyway) on the doors and bonnet (hood).  <br /><br />Creature comforts such as air-cond removed (more fuel wasted for nothing helpful to the planet), all motor-racing prohibited, and finally, tax the bejesus out of petrol/gasoline/benzine/fuel just like tobacco tax: 500%.  I'd guess that would about triple the price to approx $5.00/litre in Australia, but this would also do a great job in helping the Chinese get back on those bicycles in Beijing.  <br /><br />They can put the revenue into anti-motor-vehicle advertising, and pay for anti-motor-vehicle executives to fly around the world to conventions in electric helicopters so they can go on tv interviews and tell the masses how auto pollution is a world health hazard.</p>

	<p>There are great many examples of the majority of a profession/scientists being completely wrong.   And they ridiculed the scientists who challenged their dogma.   How can the average person know when something as complex as the cause of climate change is really known?   Considering that something like 70% of science I was taught (according to research) has now been shown to be incorrect I respect all those who are sceptical.</p>

	<p>Rubbish! You expect me to believe 70% of science you were taught was wrong? Which religious cult did you grow up in?<br />Sure. There have been a few times the majority view on science has been wrong and people like Darwin who challenged it were ridiculed, but can you ever think of a time when the overwhelming consensus in science was overturned by conspiracy theorists who don't even understand the science?</p>

	<p>Spoken by someone who apparently doesn't understand that a scientific hypothesis that matches observation, and holds to the laws of nuclear chemistry, is valid until proven otherwise by experiment.  It's a kooky idea I know, but the fact is you can't say the iron sun hypothesis is wrong without evidence and proof.  Do you have any evidence or proof that the hypothesis is wrong?  Or are you just falling back on rhetoric?<br /><br />Hint:  It's not that I think the iron sun hypothesis is correct, I have no idea.  But it exposes those like Dr Who who don't understand how science works.  (ie the process is not based on consensus).  It is amusing to watch the fools fall into the hole, and try to argue their way out with arrogant bluster.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>Evidence the iron sun hypothesis is wrong?  Let's see...<br /><br />There's the fact that spectral lines don't show much iron, despite temperatures and pressures in the heliosphere being sufficient to vaporise iron, and it should be easy to measure spectroscopically (as are hydrogen and helium, which was discovered in the sun by spectral lines before it was found on Earth).<br /><br />Then there's the fact that the physicists who have worked out the mass of the sun, never really entertained the idea that a sun of that size and mass could be comprised mostly of an element with as high a molecular mass as iron. <br /><br />We also know, from spectral lines and particle emissions, that we have hydrogen-helium fusion going on inside the sun - not going to happen if the sun is mostly iron.<br /><br />...All of which a good high school physics student ought to figure out:  If there really was any credibility to the iron sun hypothesis, there'd be a debate about it, even in school-level texts - and not just one fringe theory that every expert in the field ignores.  Greig, by not backing away very quickly from this ludicrous idea, shows us just how low his scientific literacy really is - and how willing he is to back fringe theories if they back his world view (in this case, because Manuel also happens to say stupid things about climate change that appeal to Greig's world view).  It is amusing to watch the fools fall into the hole, and try to argue their way out with arrogant bluster.<br /><br />Unfortunately, comments closed on the thread before, but I found it entertaining that he essentially recycled the &quot;climate changed before&quot; argument, saying that we shouldn't try to curtail an event which, in Earth's geological history, has been responsible for more extinctions than massive meteorite impacts.</p>

	<p>Except ...<br /><br />The spectral lines of the sun show significant amounts iron.  And Oliver Manuel is a nuclear chemist and his theory matches well with observations of the sun, spectral lines, density etc.  <br /><br />This doesn't mean I think the theory is right, only that I think you can't prove it wrong with some arrogant hand waving.</p>

	<p>Very few are discussing change isn't happening/going to happen. It is really a discussion about the cause.   And considering how much climate has changed in the past, both warming and cooling, and there was no industrialisation of note then one can understand why some are sceptical.   It would be quite funny if it turns out CO2 wasn't the factor it was thought to be (unlikely as it may be).  Bit like how we were conned on how bad saturated fats were - and now it is becoming clear that it was based on very poor science but effectively marketed, and savaging any critics.</p>

	<p>&quot;Perhaps the greatest achievement of the climate talks in Peru wasn't the goals set, but the fact that international talks like these make it increasingly hard for breakaway countries to ignore the issue&quot;<br /><br />How much money has been spend on climate talks?  The international community has failed time upon time to do anything reasonable.  <br /><br />Its local pressure that makes politicians act upon environmental matters.  These international summits allow ministers to grand stand and protesters to feel they have accomplished something.  <br /><br />Whether climate change is believed in or not, I cant see any evidence in global summits causing change to countries contributions.

	<p>While the rest of Australia is arguing about what constitutes 20% emissions reduction by 2020, South Australia has already achieved 30% of its power generation from renewable energy. Wind and solar. And the denialists tried to tell us that it &quot;wasn't base load&quot; as if that was a reason not to use renewable energy.<br /><br />Wave power is just around the corner and the Southern Ocean never sleeps.</p>

	<p>dinkumfair, SA gets to have a high wind power usage, because they can buy baseload brown coal fired electricity from Victoria. Let's see them push past 30% renewables without Victorian baseload capacity.<br /><br />You are assuming that renewables are infinitely scalable, they are not because they are intermittent.  We need a mix of sources, and even now the projection for 2050 is that globally we will still get 80% of our energy from fossil fuels.  Renewables are not the answer.</p>

	<p>The formation of my views on climate change would probably mirror many other people out there with a (non-climate) scientific background. I would class myself as a 'scientist' by trade (medical), but am certainly no expert on climate science. I was initially skeptical of climate change, on the basis of seeing so many poorly qualified commentators and their generally panicky, but ill-informed populist points of view. I also believe good science waits a while to form a clear view (certainly this attitude in medicine is associated with better health outcomes - a complex, but fascinating research area). As time went on though, the climate change supporters seemed to garner more and more evidence, and while I don't have time to go to source research to make up my mind, I am totally comfortable accepting the considered views of the many. While there will always be controversy, it is clear that the bulk of respected researchers are clear that the science is settled, and as a scientist in another area, this is good enough for me. <br /><br />Unfortunately the implications of climate change are so potentially devastating, it means that if we want to solve the problem we need to leave the science for a while and study climate change from a social and psychological perspective. In dealing with the negative aspects of climate change, on the one hand, we can all get together and commit to invest now, (which means accepting a lower standard of living as part of this investment). On the other, we can do nothing, and wait and see what happens. The actual outcome will probably skew towards the latter path, given the disparate stakeholders, their relative powers and their competing interests. So if I were able to forecast what will happen I'd say countries will do a little in the near future, but not nearly enough. Then in a decade or two's time, when the impacts become more obvious and measurable, the world will probably tackle the issue hard. The hope is that it won't be too late, but I'm confident the planet is a bit more resilient than the alarmists would have us believe. This scenario is an outcome I can really see happening. The scariest part of this scenario (assuming the earth can recover) is the potential misery inflicted on billions while we wait to act decisively. There's a real possibility that rampant 3rd world overpopulation (which will continue unabated as current technology and globalisation permits procreation at levels far beyond what the natural environment can sustain) and negative climate change effects in these poorer overpopulated countries will conspire to create a world of unforeseen misery, death and ultimately depopulation in certain regions. Using the Gaia paradigm, one might even consider this a rebalancing of the world back to a place of equilbrium. This is all an armchair exercise in future-gazing admittedly, but given human's propensity to wait until the last moment when the status quo is so damned convenient, it is, in my view the</p>

	<p>If we agree that this is an argument requiring evidence then RealityCheck will not mind providing evidence of oil, gas and coal representatives meeting in exotic countries at taxpayer expense. If shareholders paid any money for junkets that is a private enterprise issue and for them to sort out. That is not a public funding concern.<br />If the &quot;exotic&quot; countries paid that is obviously a local government carrot to encourage international investment in local industry.That is there concern.<br /><br />AHHH!!! Lima! Another place to add to the Climate Failure Junket Gabfest List including Copenhagen and Kyoto.Not that this failure is evidence of anything other than conference failure.<br /> <br />However I would appreciate some evidence upon a matter.<br /><br />National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association(NOAA)reports that CO2 registers, at The Antarctic, a 17% increase in the satellite period. About 1979 on to today.That is up by 17%.<br />Albert Wegener Institute a German, and elite, Polar and Marine research body (and an advocate of Global Warming (as is NOAA) is adamant in its measurements from its Antarctic Neumayer station that in 30 years of temperature measurement &quot;.. it has not gotten warmer over the last 30 years&quot; (Jan 2012)  More of he Guilty CO2 but no rise in temperature? And both figures from Warmist organisations<br />Falsify that.<br /><br />Finally, no one is claiming that CO2  does not have a greenhouse effect. It is a GHG! We want to know what the actual climate sensitivity is to this trace gas and we want actual evidence that irrefutably links CO2 to the rise of temperature of approximately 0.85C/0.9C from 1880 to 2013.<br />We do not want your ASSUMPTION of climate sensitivity (2C) which all your failed computer models use. If they are so accurate, then please explain why the IPCC has, within each all its reports which all rely on modelling, downgraded the climate sensitivity, hence each time they report they lessen the range of the expected temperature rise. Yet still miss the validated observations. That is Satellites. I trust  satellites are sciency enough for you people who demand we present evidence. UHA RSS GISS are the referred to organisations and they validate the Pause,<br /> <br />The IPCC and similar climate change enthusiasts like The Met of Britain and East Anglia Uni of ClimateGate fame and our UNSW ( Prof Matt England of &quot;the pause heat is hiding in the deep ocean&quot; which NASA (another Pro Global Warming organisation) recently falsified. Many other warmist organisations  have accepted a flatline of temperature unlike the stark and consistent rise as falsely predicted by the models. The models do not reflect satellite observation. Satellite observations trump models over and over and over. In Science observation is the be all and end all. <br /><br />So the Science was settled... ...OOPS, well the Science is now settled...OOPS... Well it will soon be settled...

	<p>So many words and not a valid scientific observation to be found <br />When NASA discusses deep ocean it is referring to waters in the abyss, at a depth of over 2kms, as for near the surface they say <br />&quot;The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.302 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969.&quot;<br />Ref NASA Climate Change - Evidence<br />As for the &quot; UHA RSS GISS &quot; you are referring to the manipulation of valid satellite data by Christy &amp; Spencer, both linked to a number of right wing , fossil fuel lobby financed think tanks ,  as for 'findings' Michael Mann wrote:<br />&quot;There was no scientific validity to their claims at all. And what makes matters worse, other scientists have stated that Christy seemed to do everything in his power to prevent other scientists from figuring out how they got such a strange result. These scientists were forced to deduce Christy and Spencer's errors through reverse engineering.&quot;<br />Arctic Temps: Arctic warming is causing changes to sea ice, snow cover, and the extent of permafrost in the Arctic. In the first half of 2010, air temperatures in the Arctic were 4deg Celsius (7deg Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1968 to 1996 reference period, according to NOAA.<br />Ref - Climate Change in the Arctic - National Snow and Ice Data Centre<br />Antarctic Temps: Since records began, 50 years ago, mean annual temperatures on the Antarctic Peninsula have risen rapidly [Turner, et al., 2005; Vaughan, et al., 2001; Vaughan, et al., 2003]. A total increase in mean annual air temperatures, of around 2.8 degC makes this the most rapidly warming region in the Southern Hemisphere  comparable to rapidly warming regions of the Arctic.<br />Ref: British Antarctic Survey - Antarctic Peninsula: rapid warming</p>

	<p>I think it highlights the division and the problem more than the solution. The issue has a few root causes. 1. The climate is changing: focus on that not weather it is man-made, contributed to or natural, focus on the fact it is changing. 2. Focus on the real science, not the ideology, i.e. it is not about skeptics or fanatics, it is about the mitigation of the issue (be real, we are not going to change the climate but it is going to change, so understand how, and where and what we will need to do - be real not utopian). 4. Don't focus on the difference, focus on who has expertise in what area that can help those that do not to achieve it - little steps that will snowball, not giant leaps with know strategy. 5. Each country must come up with what is good for them, achievable and realistic, without crippling economies or those that really need the help wont get it. Money and economies are a factor, and to ignore that is see what we are seeing now - no progress. Climate is changing, and has done for billions of years, in the scheme of things we know very little, so focus on what we know and can realistically achieve, not airy fairy targets and technology that wont cut it. Bit of common sense, not rhetoric will help; cheers :)</p>

Your credibility is showing.<br /><br />Germany has now spent 16 billion euros on wind farms and solar, and an undisclosed huge amount in retiring nuclear plants, and now can't control its distribution system or energy cost. In some instances Germany pays for surrounding countries to offload excess power, and then whimpers through cold nights begging for power from other Euro sources.<br /><br />Not, I would assume, what even Christian would think was reasonable, but this barrow keeps getting pushed.<br /><br />And Christian, I really wouldn't go touting that China breakthrough &quot;by 2030&quot;. You haven't lived in China but I have, and China loves nothing more than gullible people like you. <br /><br />And talking about the &quot;point at which climate change becomes unimaginable&quot; I've heard that tale quite a few times. It's always five years from now...but unfortunately for you a number of those five year predictions have proved to be useless BS. And I'd be happy for you to peer review that.</p>

	<p>&quot;In some instances Germany pays for surrounding countries to offload excess power, and then whimpers through cold nights begging for power from other Euro sources.&quot;<br />No your credibility is showing, in 2011 Germany became a net energy exporter, so they SELL excess energy to other countries, and FYI in Germany 99% of heating is central heating  (oil) or gas, not electric</p>

	<p>It's interesting that Christian Downie doesn't mention the word 'poverty'.  Energy poverty is a key issue both for poor countries at these talks, and for rich countries as well.  The core problem is that poor people need access to much more energy -- much more -- to lift their living standards.  Without much more energy, many billions of people will remain very poor.  So here is the central issue -- how can the world tackle the CO2 problem while providing lots more energy to poor people?  Right now, the only answers seem to be with either coal or nuclear.  On current technologies, there is unfortunately no chance that other sources of energy (solar, wind, gas) will do the job.</p>

	<p>When RE can supply enough energy to produce itself, from the mining of the ores required right through to the manufacture, it will be a credible energy source. <br /><br />Unfortunately if it ever can it is a long way in the future. The current production of RE sources its energy mainly from fossil fuels, some nuclear and a wee bit of hydro(RE). We will know when it is not so, proponents of RE will inform us.</p>

	<p>Where are the Pacific Island nations that are under water? This was predicted to happen by 2012, where are they? Crying wolf tends to lead to your opinions being disregarded.<br /><br />The UN was salivating at the chance of getting their hands on all that loot from gullible nations. Too bad some have an independent view as shown by the contempt that China and India et al have shown to the proposal to limit emissions.</p>
