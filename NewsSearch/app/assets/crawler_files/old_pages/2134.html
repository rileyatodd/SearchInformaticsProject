       The pressure is on for PM Tony Abbott to reshuffle his ministry. <span class="source">(Liberal.org.au)</span>
      </a></div>
</div>
  <p><strong><em>In an effort to display stability Tony Abbott has resisted calls to reshuffle his cabinet, but that has meant keeping some deadwood from the Howard years and stifling ambitious backbenchers, writes Paula Matthewson.</em></strong></p><p>During the Howard government years, the prime minister often took the opportunity to refresh his ministry by reshuffling it just before or after the Christmas break.</p><p>When done before Christmas, the reshuffle gave new ministers time to familiarise themselves with their portfolios and reduce the chance of newbie mistakes once the Parliament resumed in February.</p><p>Reshuffles conducted in January helped give a sense of renewal without upheaval, using the dawning of the new year as a way of drawing a line under the previous year and looking ahead to new and fresh perspectives and approaches.</p><p>As we approach the end of the Abbott Government's first full year in power, the pressure is on for PM Tony Abbott to similarly reshuffle his ministry. The PM may be pitching 2014 as a year of achievement for his Government, but ambitious backbenchers and even some restless ministers are advocating a reshuffle as a circuit breaker from the blunders and woes of 2014.</p><p>To date, Abbott has resisted calls to refresh the ministry he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet_of_Malcolm_Turnbull">inherited</a> in opposition after beating Malcolm Turnbull by one vote for the Liberal leadership. Only <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Parliamentary_Handbook/Current_Ministry_List">minimal changes</a> have been made since that time, mostly to fill vacancies created by the retirement of MPs.</p><p>Abbott's stated rationale for resisting wholesale change has been to provide continuity and a sense of stability. His unstated motivation has been to provide a stark comparison with the instability that wracked the Rudd and Gillard governments.</p><p>But this desire to maintain the status quo also suggests Abbott is concerned that his hold on the party room could be fragile and at risk of being fractured by the dissatisfaction that a reshuffle would inevitably produce.</p><p>In some respects it was a smart move on Abbott's part to keep MPs with previous ministerial experience on his first frontbench. No less than 20 in Abbott's ministry served in the last ministry of the Howard government.<strong> </strong>They were therefore familiar with how government works and had limited teething problems in taking over portfolios from their Labor predecessors.</p><p>The downside to such a cautious approach is that Abbott remains saddled with some of Howard's deadwood, including ministers who have been decidedly uninspiring since their return to government such as Defence Minister David Johnston, Health Minister Peter Dutton, and Environment Minister Greg Hunt.</p><p>Meantime a bunch of talented backbenchers have been cooling their heels, not always containing their impatience to try new approaches and inject fresh ideas. Some of these young guns have been biding their time since being elected more than a decade ago, while others have only been in parliament for half that time.</p><p>A fair proportion of this up-and-coming talent comes from Victoria, where the federal Coalition is doing less well than in other states, and the Liberal state government recently received a drubbing thanks in no small part to badly timed and unhelpful announcements from the Abbott Government.</p><p>Even before Abbott hung the Victorian state Liberals out to dry, the young guns had been restive and agitating for change. Some of the complaints about the PM's chief of staff, Peta Credlin, have come from these quarters.</p><p>Other calls for a reshuffle are coming from within the ministry itself, where ambitious ministers such as Scott Morrison are looking for fresh challenges and opportunities to consolidate their power.</p><p>Abbott is right, however, to be cautious about yielding to pressure for a reshuffle, and to be concerned that it could prove to be destabilising. He knows that not everyone can be satisfied with a rearrangement of the deck chairs.</p><p>Even on the conservative side of politics, ministerial positions are apportioned according to a range of factors. While it would be fair to expect only the most competent MPs to be appointed, the ministry composition must also take into account the proportion of seats held by the Liberals and Nationals, the number of seats held in each state and territory, and the sharing of ministerial positions across the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p><p>This would require Abbott having to sack or demote (which can be even more demoralising) existing ministers from Victoria in order to promote any of the young guns from that state. The same applies for ambitious MPs from any other state or territory looking to move up the ministerial hierarchy.</p><p>So even if a poorly-performing minister such as Western Australia's David Johnston were to be counselled out the door, he would likely be replaced by another Western Australian. This is why noises are being made that it is time to tap longtime Victorian MP and Minister for Social Services, Kevin Andrews, on the shoulder.</p><p>It's important to note that Howard usually reshuffled his ministry in the 12 months leading up to the next federal election, whereas Abbott is barely 12 months into his first term. If the PM were to follow the Howard template, he'll have to make do with the ministry he has for another 12 months.</p><p>This of course presupposes that Abbott is still in a position to do so. It's too early to gauge the true extent of combined party room angst over Peta Credlin's management style and the unshuffled ministry. Ultimately, it will be a different concern - that over the Government's poor electoral standing - that leads to the most destructive type of party room unrest.</p><p><em>Paula Matthewson is a freelance communications adviser and corporate writer.

	<p>A reshuffle would be like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.  <br /><br />Nothing will save this Government, the Liberal Party dogma is so entrenched that new faces will just do the same thing as those faces currently there.<br /><br />Even if Joe Hockey put in the money for his cigars today, there is no way this Government whether reshuffled or not will be re-elected.  They are definitely on the Titanic.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>&quot;Nothing will save this Government&quot;<br /><br />So the next election is, in your view, unlosable as far as the ALP is concerned? Bold words. Many an unlosable election has been lost and Labor has the better part of two years to find a way to do just that. Shorten leading during an election campaign is of course untested, Labor's policies are (in the face of the current economic situation) likely to be tinkering at the edges with the government's current policies at best and the electorate is luke-warm on the idea of a Labor-Greens power-sharing arrangement which is how the polls are currently suggesting Labor might need to govern.<br /><br />Things look bad for the government, sure, but they're not looking apples for the ALP either.</p>

	<p>&quot;I heard Australian vote out governments not vote them in.&quot;<br /><br />There's some truth to that but it's by no means automatic that a bad government will be replaced by a bad opposition. Two recent examples of unpopular governments being re-elected due to there being no better alternative are NSW 2007, when millions of poor voters felt they had no option but to return a very unpopular and arrogant government, and SA this year when federal factors clearly helped a government which looks hopelessly lost get back in by their fingernails.<br /><br />The difference between those two cases and the federal government today is that the opposition hasn't spent years in opposition. Is that good or bad for the ALP? I'm not convinced it's good but others may disagree.</p>

	<p>Dave,<br /><br />Good point.  My hypothesis is that the current ALP grouping will react in the same way as happened after the Whitlam years.   It is said that one of the reasons the Hawke/Keating government did so well is that they learnt from the upheaval of the last time the ALP was in government.   This gave them focus and direction.<br /><br />I'm just hoping that the scenario replays out to the extent that Bill Shorten is the modern day version of Bill Hayden and that there is another Hawkey in the wings.</p>

	<p>That's the problem with the 2 party system we have at the moment.<br /><br />What happens when both sides are incompetent?<br /><br />All the partisan posting in the world can't hide the fact that we have some very average politicians running our country and I don't things will change in the foreseeable future.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>But we're not restricted to just those two parties.  There are plenty of other parties to vote for.  It's just that those two have been the dominant parties for such a long time and so many voters insist on giving them first preferences.  If you want a true multi-party system, vote for other parties and encourage others to do the same.  The fault is not in our system, it's in our votes.  <br /><br />The positives are that more negotiation has to take place, hopefully leading to more reasonable legislation.  The negatives are a higher likelihood of instability (see Israel, Italy for examples).</p>

	<p>There is no sense in voting for a minor party just as a reaction against the two party system.  The minor parties first need to show that they are competent to govern.  So far they are all far from proving they are capable of governing themselves let alone run the country.</p>

	<p>Your idea is good but the majority of voters will still vote for either LNP or Labor. So no matter who you vote for they will always give their preferences to one or tother of the majors.<br /><br />The only chance we have of ever getting away from the 2 party plan is to disband both parties and insist they act as independents.<br /><br />We have to chuck away the affiliations to an organisation and make our members work only for their constituents. Anything else is doomed to failure.<br /></p>

	<p>I see it a little differently. We have very average politicians running the country on behalf of  narrow vested interest groups with the majority of Australians feeling unrepresented or worse, stereotyped to the point that their individuality is reduced to a target group; feeling marginalised through innuendo and attacks or sick off the gladiatorial political stoushes that make a great spectacle whilst achieving nothing. Look at the list that in one year the Coalition has attacked. The list of individuals, groups and organisations including sectors of industry is long and getting longer. Political suicide or blind ignorant and arrogant zealotry?<br /><br />The only thing that our modern day party politicians have achieved is entrenching a system of unaccountability and protection where lies are dismissed and glossed over by more lies and where a generally mainstream commentariat is used to find a palatable way with words and slants that excuse and justify incompetence, deceit and plain human nastiness. <br />Astuteness is something our modern day party pollies still possess. I think a shake up is closer. I think our PM will be forced to sacrifice at least one head. Based on conservative commentators like Piers Ackermann, it seems the favoured scalp is Peta Credlin to defuse what even he and other friendly commentators are unable to explain away as anything other than open anger and dissent. It wouldn't be sexist in nature though. She is unelected after all. She has done the job she was tasked with by the central power within the Liberal Party executive and the small gang of Liberal politicians that plotted Malcolm Turnbull's removal by one vote. Trouble is they know that Mr Abbott needs another strong minder, let loose his mouth will wreak even greater havoc and national and international mirth and smirk.<br /><br />The fact is Paula that the stagnation (and the widening view that it has caused pain throughout the economy for no gain) that has enveloped this government is worse than the solution.<br />The Coalition has played the gladiatorial game too long for there not be be a &quot;death&quot; to end it for now.  <br /><br /></p>

	<p>I'll disagree with you on the SA election, it was the poor campaigning by the local LNP &amp; lack of negotiating skills that got the ALP back in power at the last election here. The LNP also poured money into already safe seats but spent little on marginal seats they could have won easily with a little more effort &amp; spending on a good campaign. They also suffered from the federal LNP problem of just putting the ALP government down but not giving a reasonable alternative. They also pored heaps of money into a negative campaign against Bob Such in Fisher, that did them no good &amp; then did the same in the by-election, concentrating on the independent &amp; not the ALP candidate. It's gone to a recount but I think that they will lose by a very slim margin.</p>

	<p>Probably more accurate to say its all over for Abbot, more than the liberals, unless they decide to cling on to him, in which case, they'll go down with him.<br />I cant see how Abbott could possibly win back anyones trust, given that he still doesnt seem to understand how badly he has damaged it.<br /><br />Playing the role of the nations protector, during crisis times, hasnt worked.<br />Rubbing shoulders with the high &amp; mighty's at the G20 didn't work.<br />Claiming he has kept faith with the Australian people, is only making it worse, each time he says it.<br />Dragging up Labors old unpopular decisions of the past, is a poor excuse to try and justify his own unpopular decisions.<br /><br />On the flip side, I can see he just wants to fix the economy which means pain for us, which he promised he wouldnt put us through.<br />Ahh, but he lied and got caught, just like Julia Gillard.<br /><br />He should have adopted a more open &amp; honest approach from the very start, but its a bit late to start that now.<br />He has blown his trust account, what little of it there was.<br />Unless he can develop the most amazing salesmanship skills the world has ever seen, not too many people will want to deposit any more of their trust into his account again.<br /><br />If he hopes time will make people forget, he only has to remember the passing of time didnt improve anything for Gillard, after she was convicted for the same crime.<br /><br />Surely, to prevent this current labor mob from sneaking back into power, sooner or later Abbot will need to step aside.<br />Surely this has dawned on him already. Will he do it?? I think, if it comes down to it, he will.</p>

	<p>The greatest threats to Abbott are not in ALP ranks, they are in the Coalition ranks especially amongst the wets. While this government is on the nose, the most popular alternate government remains a Coalition one - just have a look at alternate PM polling. I suggest we will see a Bishop/Turnbull government prior to the next election, and the political death of not just Abbott and possibly Hockey (I 'spose he'll survive) but of much of the current front bench - Dutton, Andrews, Johnston spring to mind immediately.</p>

	<p>&quot;The greatest threats to Abbott are not in ALP ranks, they are in the Coalition &quot;<br /><br />Anyone that has followed politics with more than a passing interest over the last decade or so know this to be true.<br /><br />Abbott was put there because the &quot;drys&quot; couldn't abide a &quot;wet&quot; like Turnbull. They put him up against Rudd possibly thinking Rudd would eat him alive and end his carreer.<br /><br />So much for history. Abbott as an opposition leader was unsurpassed. Pity is traits like constant negativity, lack of vision, inability to negotiate, lack of empathy, a loosness with the truth, and sheer obstiance are ok if you're a Leader of the Opposition. To run a country you need traits diametrically opposite, traits Abbott shows a distinct lack of.<br /><br />My great fear now is he'll exploit this deadfull situation in Sydney over the coming weeks to boost his poll numbers. The man has shown in the past he is more than willing to preach from the top of coffin (Bernie Banton or the first Malaysian plane anyone?). <br /><br />So far he has been reasonable understated - except with the &quot;politically motivated&quot; comment. As events unfold this morning it is looking more likely this was a one off by a seriously deranged man. A smarter leader would have not speculated.</p>

	<p>Section 8 care to give a source for those numbers they look a bit elevated to me. The Liberals will win in NSW next year but with a reduced majortiy. I suspect they'll lose around 15 seats from the 2011 election and wont hold a seat on the Central Coast or Hunter. Seats that have been Labor since they were first created will come back too. I look forward to the fresh round of Liberal fronting ICAC as well.</p>

	<p>Yes Sir Trent looks like the proverbial landslide. There's not much talent in the LNP. Robb is a complete fool who helped destroy manufacturing in this country. Baaanaby Joyce is a pathetic Agriculture minister who nearly destroyed SPC. Hockey worst treasurer ever. Bishop as foreign minister is a disaster costing rural areas 400million in trade with Russia and insulting an US president. Turnbull managed to destroy the NBN and made it cost more than the original estimate. What a hopeless lot of fools this government is.</p>

	<p>Well the next election is a year and a half away so anything is possible but I wouldn't/t want to be in Abbott's shoes.<br /><br />To win Abbott could use an improvement in the economy, more episodes like the Sydney one and Labor to be unable to formulate sound: economic, asylum seeker and security measures.<br /><br />Much too early to tell for certain that is IF Abbott is still PM.

	<p>The 2013 election appeared to me a good one to lose-in regards to domestic and international economic problems.They are becoming increasingly complexed and worrisome .2 years out from an election -it is not beyond the possibility of the ecomony flatlining or in recession.Abbott and Hockey's  derlima is the inability to have the reassuring style of Howard and Costello to deliver economic stability .The chicken little bleating before after the budget falls short and others in the cabinet have fallen into line-now unemployment is slowly showing it's ugly dial-the public are looking for government answers.Is it cutting some good and indifferent government agencies.Spending bucks on national security for subs with a poor salesman at the helm.Handing over $200 mil for global warming .Paid parental leave confusion left in limbo-child care underfunded , It will come at a cost.Cutbacks in renewable industry- now we import most inventory.Expensive excursions to O/S trouble spots.Squeezing welfare for the middle income earners who are the better spenders for our consumer dominated society? Squeeze the welfare dependant - what is fair? Abbott wasn't the greatest Minister of Health, he is now a Prime Minister of fairly lackluster appeal as was his 2 predecessors. Hockey , was called a Boofhead in parliament as Minister of Tourism.If they were fighting the GFC with a bucket of cash they maybe lauded, so tough times requires political acumen that they don't quite possess-the world has bought Obama for years , style over substance .The problem for Labor is a recent history and a leader , that lacks a bit of substance.2 years is a long time and many events economically , politically, socially have to pass-you are always one scandal/infight away from oblivion.House prices don't rise for ever.You never know the 2016 election might be  an even better one to lose.</p>

	<p>The 2013 election was one where a party resorted to returning a leader found to be &quot;dysfunctional&quot; and &quot;psychotic&quot; by his own senior ministers.  Its troubling when its the ministers that know a government best.  A person with no economic plan and who had already done a double back flip on climate change and border protection. <br /><br />vs<br /><br />A political animal with significant good or bad achievements as a minister who made promises that where mutually exclusive.  It was always going to be impossible to bring a surplus without cuts to most things and no serious tax rises.  <br /><br />We had a proven failure as PM vs a politician selling the impossible.  <br /><br />At least the next PM has a reduced public service, a serious chance to tackle federation and if they play the cards right room to raise taxes in order for Australia to live within its means.</p>

	<p>&quot;Things look bad for the government, sure, but they're not looking apples for the ALP either.&quot;<br /><br />The current polls have Labor in a winning position federally, couple that with the Victorian state election and the South Australian by-election, I'm must be missing what makes you think that it is &quot;not looking apples for the ALP&quot;.<br /><br />Of course, it is a long way to the next election, and it is remotely conceivable that the LNP will realise that it has to engatge with the swinging voters (middle ground) to gain enough support win, but I find that VERY unlijkley given the current crop of<br />idealogically driven Ministers. Not only that, the appallingly gaff-ridden Prime Minister is a mill-stone aroung their collective necks.<br /><br />All Labor has to continue to mimic the tactics used by Mr Abbott in opposition and their probability of winning is high. Let's make no mistake, Mr Abbott was a brilliant attack dog leader of the opposition, but sadly, the LNP did not take the time to consider how they would counter their own tactics turned back on themselves. They are paying the price and will continue to do so, until there is a significant circuit breaker applied to the inept Ministry.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

Face it Dave, she lost the 2013 election as soon as the carbon tax became law.<br /><br />Just like Howard lost the 2007 election as soon as WorkChoices became law in 2005.<br /><br />No amount of election sweeteners soften up a hostile voting public anymore!<br /><br />Open your eyes Dave!!</p>

	<p>@Dazza, Aja is not merely pointing out that the government has little support, Aja is promising a change of government. If your prediction is that the next government will be neither Labor nor Liberal then I'm discounting your opinion immediately.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I'll agree you're a genius if it turns out to be the correct call.</p>

	<p>History says this government is already dead. Anything could happen, but it probably won't. Abbott was unpopular even when he won the election, and they have had no &quot;honeymoon&quot;, and they are going to face an increasingly difficult economic situation. Short of starting a war, history says they die in a little over 18 months (and even a war might not save them, ask Menzies).<br /><br />The only question is where the real threat comes from - inside the party room or from across the floor in parliament.</p>

	<p>Abbott is hoping that something on the world stage will deflect the public's attention from his inept government.<br /><br />We really needed his assurances today about some nutter in a Melbourne Coffee shop. He appeared on TV to to tell us not be afraid, and go about our business as normal.  The NSW Commissioner eventually got on and injected a bit of rational common sense. The Prime Minister also offered Federal assistance, and should have been told that the Feds just received an additional $500mil to stop this sort of thing at its source, and the state police can handle it from here thank you.<br /><br />However something really momentous has to happen before you can hopefully come to the conclusion that he coalition deserves another term.<br /><br />Abbott cannot bring new blood into his Ministry, because the standard usually applying to reshuffles is that you get rid of inept ministers. He would have to he the first to go.</p>

	<p>Yes Tom, it's rather ironic that Tony Abbott just a few short weeks ago, ramped up the old &quot;War on Terror&quot; rhetoric to fever pitch and now he calls for calm and common sense - nothing to be alarmed about!  <br /><br />Seems to have fallen on deaf ears as far as our tv stations are concerned.  They have all chosen to drop their programs to stay with this siege situation, ensuring everyone is 'alarmed' and as well, successfully diverting any reporting of Joe Hockey's MYEFO from our view.  I find THAT alarming...</p>

	<p>We are now in a position of being able to speak with a knowledge of the tragic outcome.<br /><br />It appears that the offender was a &quot;Nutter&quot; albeit of the Muslim faith.<br /><br />Most news outlets, particularly Sky News spent the entire day with the assumption that this was a terrorist event attached to Isil.  It made for better news, and Stan Grant repeated his views and knowledge of the Isil movement so many times that it would have been impossible for the public not to have become concerned that we were under attack from a terrorist movement.<br /><br />It turns out that the offender was a common criminal, apparently working alone, and friendless who said he loved Australia, but had a problem with authorities, and was as his Lawyer said &quot;Damaged goods&quot;.<br /><br />Coverage of this incident makes one thankful for the balance of the ABC.<br /><br />Lets us hope that our politicians do not take advantage of this situation to push any political agenda, when the real discussion should be around things like bail conditions, and police reaction to violence of this kind.</p>

	<p>Yes anything could happen.<br /><br />The coalition could reveal more of their nasty hidden agenda, break more promises (if there are any left to break), let slip more elitist gaffes and cause more disgruntlement within their own ranks to spill out into public view.<br /><br />The economic situation is only going to get worse, partly because they've destroyed any optimism, slowly removing ability to spend in the economy and partly from external effects.<br /><br />I honestly can't see any improvement. The best they can hope for is distraction, like the Sydney siege.</p>

	<p>Aja unfortunately it is we who are also aboard the Titanic and it is the ministers who will gain access to the lifeboats - not us.<br /><br />Both political parties are much the same with their priorities being loyalty toward their own party members (much the same as banks have their first loyalty to their shareholders rather than their customers).<br /><br />This government will be saved by the party machine. The only alternative is the Labor Party and I have to ask everyone: Will a Liberal loss in the next election make any real difference?<br /><br />The Two Party system has failed us. Much more than the Liberal Party has failed in governance.<br /><br />Next election we must think carefully and choose to vote. Lets try to avoid this same set of problems (from both sides) by voting out the Party system.<br /></p>

	<p>agreed, but the problem is that our votes get given to someone else by most of the minor parties.<br /><br />Honestly, I would actually vote for something i don't believe in at this point to get rid of the liberals because there just is not a party worth voting for.<br /><br />If we had a progressive party who intends to reform the political system and outlaw bribery (we call it donations for some reason), has a social, environmental AND Economic conscience, they would get my vote.<br /><br />we don't need the status quo anymore, we need progress, modernization and change for the better and integration of technology in the voting process (real time voting etc). That doesn't mean we wreck the economy by default and doesn't mean we create more &quot;leaners&quot; either - its about intelligence, balance and efficiency.</p>

	<p>SBE: You are too quick to believe anti Labor rhetoric.<br /><br />Consider this. Howard had the greatest influx of revenue, thanks to China, imaginable. He himself was fairly stable, even though he began to believe his own publicity.  His main shortcoming was his profligacy, leaving massive structural deficits.  He was not great on infrastructure,the best he could do was a fairly unnecessary railway line between Alice Springs and Darwin, as a pork barrel.<br /><br />Labor had to contend with the GFC, and a fairly disruptive Rudd. Nevertheless it did have policies that were in the interests of the nation, and the Rudd influence aside exacerbated by a foreign news mogul, it was a successful government.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>Howard was the last PM to implement a lasting tax reform.<br /><br />The GST<br /><br />Rudd and Gillard could not keep a tax in place after they lost an election.  They increased taxes in some areas and tried a carbon price which ultimately failed.  The ALP had revenue increases every year.  They also had a new program to try and implement through forward estimates every month.  <br /><br />Something like the NDIS whilst very worthy needed full funding before announcement instead of partial funding months after announcement.</p>

	<p>IMBY:  The carbon price was a global warming measure. Agreed it was defeated, or rescinded by a climate change denialist. Now we are bordering on being an international pariah in that area.  The GST was once dead and buried by Howard, and really is a lazy way to raise taxes.<br /><br />Can you add to the list of Howard's major infrastructure achievements?</p>

	<p>The problem starts with Abbott who has been one of the poorest performers in his team. An honest team leader would have admitted the problems and stepped aside (Baillieu's actions in Victoria spring to mind) and it would then be up to the new PM to select a cabinet and make the running. But Abbott is unlikely to fall on his sword as he is a pliant tool of the Liberal Party's decision makers. So that probably applies to the people he has in his ministry who are products of the same selection process.<br /><br />As a suggestion based on their perceived performance one can name a number who should be on the back bench now. Pyne who has shown a crashing ineptitude for reading the mood of the public, or actually doing anything; Johnston who seems incapable in whatever job he is handed - he wasn't much better in the Howard days; Hunt has been a sheer disappointment who went into the job of Environment with apparent environmental principles and has since completely folded on every issue allowing Abbott to become de facto Environment Minister. Dutton's only contribution is stand behind Abbott nodding his head or otherwise just imitating a stunned mullet; while Turnbull is either adopting the Teddy Roosevelt maxim of walking softly and carrying a big stick or just going through the motions - I tend to follow the latter view.<br /><br />Poor old Joe Hockey talked big and then made a big hole in his own credibility and has not only destroyed that, but also destroyed any perception he'd be a better PM than Abbott. So now that we can see just how bad a performer Abbott is (and it isn't as if we weren't forewarned), and we realise that there is no one on the front bench who we can have confidence in as PM that can take over, perhaps we should have that election and consign them to dustbin of failed governments quickly. It would be a kindness to put them and us out of our misery. If the front bench is this bad, God alone knows how bad the back bench is.</p>

	<p>Correct Malcolm,the deterioration  of Parliamentry standards started when Abbott took the leadership,and  now in Government has seemed incapable of taking the step from  a negative Opposition leader to Leader of a coherent Govt.How long can we accept  a leader that is the butt of jokes around the world extending back to his Opposition days.</p>

	<p>I think it's time for a reshuffle of the Government's front bench.   It's clear that some renewal is needed and a fresh approach would draw a line under the chaos that seems to be endless.<br /><br />My suggestion is that any reshuffle be a whole of cabinet reorganisation.   I think Mr Abbott could elect to take on the position as Minister for Sport and relieve himself of the onerous responsibilities of the Prime Ministership.   He has shown a marked ability in the area of sport and has yet to make a policy decision in this area that has negatively affected the Government's position in the polls.</p>

	<p>I've heard there are plenty of travel allowances to be claimed, as well. On a more serious note, I beg to differ with Paula Matthewson's claim &quot;MPs with previous ministerial experience (were kept) on his first frontbench. No less than 20 in Abbott's ministry served in the last ministry of the Howard government. They were therefore familiar with how government works and had limited teething problems in taking over portfolios from their Labor predecessors.&quot; <br /><br />The first six months of the Abbott government had no comment from any Minister and all of them deferring questions to other Ministers under the pretense of &quot;not my portfolio.&quot; This behaviour displayed &quot;limited teething problems&quot; only to the gullible. They were unprofessional and lazy then as now. Does anyone remember Abbott's behaviour in not reading policy or media documents but opining anyway?</p>

	<p>I've always had the impression that Mr Abbott has a very strong work ethic.   My perception, however, is that he seems to be easily distracted and comes up with solutions to problems without thinking about the consequences of these actions other than how it will play out in the media today.<br /><br />In many respects I suspect that the best politicians would have a mindset like a good chess player.  Able to think a number of moves ahead, always considering what the opposition will do and coming up with counter moves.   Sadly I don't think there are many of this type of politician around today.   After all such a mindset needs an ability to think beyond the current news cycle.</p>

	<p>I think Abbott is by nature fairly conscientious. The problem is not distraction I suspect (mind you the Labor cheerleaders here do a great attempt at trying to distract), but more like political feng shui. Sentient oppositions always see and feel things differently to sentient Governments.<br /><br />The policy ideas really need to be formulated in Opposition and put into practice in Government. Chess moves only work when you've got one opponent to worry about. Modern governments have got many. That's probably why they don't bother any more; it's too hard.</p>

	<p>&quot;Abbott's stated rationale for resisting wholesale change has been to provide continuity and a sense of stability&quot;<br /><br />It's working. The polls have continued to be stable for a year now.<br /><br />It's also worth pointing out that you can shuffle a pack consisting solely of jokers as many times as you like; every card you then start turning over will still be the same.

	<p>Paula's referring to deck chairs was probably pretty right. It's all very well to come up with a review of possible changes but the fact of the matter is that there is a whole bunch of ministers who pursue policies not to the satisfaction of voters. Those displaced would be unhappy and the people who would replace them can be presumed to be of a similar ilk when it comes to policies. <br /><br />It all looks like lose/lose to me.</p>

	<p>Paula how does Abbott point the finger when he and his treasurer have let the opposition undermine their first budget.<br /><br />Shorten and Bowen with a little help from Milne have been able to paint the government's Austerity as unnecessary. Now as that tactic appears to be uncertain given the latest forecast they are now successfully claiming the government is targeting the wrong people.  <br /><br />Abbott and Hockey should have the data and the rhetoric to turn this around and call Shorten out but have failed.  So how does Abbott go about shuffling himself out.<br /></p>

	<p>That would be because Shorten, Bowen and Milne have a little more national economic nous than Abbott, Hockey and you.<br />That is why Abbott and Hockey don't have the, &quot;data and rhetoric to turn this around and call Shorten out&quot;. The data and rhetoric don't exist, except in the minds of those limited to household economics.<br />If household economics is what you, Abbott and Hockey understand, that is exactly what you, Abbott and Hockey should stick to.<br />Even if austerity is necessary, loading it onto the least able to bear it is unfair, unnecessary and unwise. Destroying your research capability and education sectors is simply stupid. Wiping out a functioning Carbon Scheme and Resources Rent Tax is completely irresponsible.<br />Before you jump up and down, I'm one of those paying the Deficit Levy, (tax by any other name).

	<p>If Labor was still our government I can assure you that the debt and deficit would be much much lower than it is now.  Abbott and Hockey don't have a clue.  Toc has explained some of that to you.  No one has undermined the Hockey budget - it remains a complete crock even though most has been passed.  It's a whopping lie that the Libs are any good at economic management.  They are reaping what they sowed.  BS.</p>

	<p>Seriously how can you assure us that the debt would be less, than it is now. With commodity prices falling, the mining tax would not have brought in any revenue, there's a 15 billion hole in the budget because labor attached 15 billion in spending to the mining tax (a large majority was middle class welfare). What policies did labor have to grow the economy and create employment, i cant remember any. I know it had a bunch of spending policies, NBN, NDIS, Goneski, plus off course the 4% public service efficiency dividend. My question than is if labor were in government, what would it do, remember it has 400 billion in debt and 40 billion in deficits and no realistic way to get back to surplus.</p>

	<p>the NBN was an economy growing policy. A fast, reliable network adds to productivity and GDP.<br /><br />We lose billions to people being unproductive in cars. A fast, RELIABLE network would have facilitated more SMEs and people working from home, as well as other things like e-health.<br /><br />It also would have been infrastructure that facilitates that transitions us away from digging holes in the ground (and it would have done for decades, not A decade, before needing replacement).</p>

	<p>&quot;Last year, the Treasurer began his budget speech declaring, and I quote: ?the four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement of the?success of our policies?.<br />Well, surpluses would have been a vindication.<br />But there are no surpluses.<br />Not this year.<br />Not next year.<br />Not the year after that.<br />The Treasurer now says that there will be a surplus in four years? time.<br />That?s four years after the Treasurer and the Prime Minister said that it had already actually been delivered and spent tens of thousands of your dollars boasting about it in letters to their constituents.<br />If a public company made these sorts of claims its directors would most likely face serious charges rather than asking to be re-elected.<br />If this had been the only dodgie promise, they might have got away with it but this government never gets it right.&quot;<br /><br />The Hon Tony Abbott in his Budget reply speech 2013 - full speech on his website<br /><br />Thanks for the clarity Tony - say no more</p>

	<p>&quot;Paula how does Abbott point the finger when he and his treasurer have let the opposition undermine their first budget.&quot;<br /><br />That's because it's NOT a budget!   It's just an ideological blueprint to keep the poor where they are and allow those who are born to rule to maintain the status quo!<br /><br />Just take Smokin' joe's statements yesterday...<br /><br />&quot;The Government has decided to use the budget which is stronger than it was 12 months ago as a shock absorber for the biggest fall in our export prices in many years,&quot;<br /><br />Say WHAT?  The budget and economy are WORSE than 12 months ago by every measure!<br /><br />&quot;we put in place reforms that have helped to make us a more prosperous nation,&quot;<br /><br />HUH?   What reforms? And what measure of &quot;prosperity&quot; are we talkng about?<br /><br />Nobody can make a cogent argument that shirkning the public sector by tens ouf thousands at a time like this is going to improve the economy or make the nation more prosperous.   It might give the right wing ideologues a warm and fuzzy but the nation is going to pay a high price just to make a few people satisfied.<br /><br />And let's not get started on the impact on the economy of 30,000 mining sector job losses in the last two years about to be followed by tens of thousands of auto manufacturing job losses!   That's a lot of money about to disappear from the economy and small businesses are going to suffer, and in turn shed the jobs they currently support.<br /><br />Recession on the way, people!   Just don't forget you voted for it!<br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>Hang on now. Eleven months before the last election Swan and Gillard emphatically claimed in a national broadcast &quot;forget the press club&quot; that there would be a surplus before the election. Instead they delivered a 300 billion Dollar hole. So I wouldn't get too carried away with predictions.</p>

	<p>gbe: Hockey, if he was the Treasurer material he thought he was should have been aware of what he was saying. The fact that he is no better that predicting surpluses than Swan should not make him any better than he is.<br /><br />The Coalition has bad the treasury benches for nearly 18 months, surely it is time that it claims responsibility for its own actions.

	<p>There is no end to the selective memories here. Let me get this right your saying there is no budget emergency and no falling revenue plus billions in interest payments are all a Hockey lie to make us miserable because he is mean.<br /><br />And Swan the worlds greatest treasurer never had a mining boom and never wasted billions not to mention a carbon tax that didn't cut carbon emissions and MRRT designed by miners that cost tax money instead of raising it. And you want them back. Goodness Me !!.<br />.</p>

	<p>I doubt there was any significant change in the other major party opposing when Abbott was opposition leader.  <br /><br />The name &quot;Dr No&quot; was complete crock because Abbott has never claimed to be a Dr and said &quot;Yes&quot; far more often during parliamentary votes.  <br /><br />I suspect the current labor party is opposing a lot more.  For one, they are opposing their own saving measures they took to the election.</p>

	<p>&quot;The name &quot;Dr No&quot; was complete crock because Abbott has never claimed to be a Dr&quot;<br /><br />Know how I can tell you're under 30? 'Dr No' is a pop culture reference from over fifty years ago, being the name of the first James Bond film. It's a generic nickname in politics, not unlike Blind Freddy or Lame Duck. No one ever suggested Abbott has claimed to be a doctor, I can assure you.</p>

	<p>you lot said Abbott wouldn't survive as opposition leader he did, you lot said Abbott would not win an election he did, you lot now say Abbott will be disposed by his own government, i very much doubt it. You lot know say Abbott won't win the next election 2 years out, again i'm sure your 100 right as above. the way your predictions are going Abbott will be PM for 10 years.  <br />With the DD election, it cant happen because there are no triggers (eg no legislation has been rejected twice by the senate). Plus the GG does not have the power to step in and run the government without the queens approval. FYI, i think you now know how frustrated the righties were when gillard and rudd were in office.</p>

	<p>Excellent analysis and discussion Paula...<br /><br />Mr Abbott has declined to consider a ministerial reshuffle and has had his &quot;team&quot; (a loosely defined term) by his side since he took the Leadership in Opposition.<br /><br />He has their loyalty and he remains loyal to his team. So far so good and I commend his loyalty.<br /><br />Yet Mr Abbott has a far greater loyalty to honour: his loyalty to the people and nation. <br /><br />His government is plainly dysfunctional.

	<p>I voted for Labour for the last time in 2007. In the last election I couldn't bring myself to vote for either major party so I ended going with the local independent. Shorten's history of helping to backstab Rudd and then taking down Gillard to save himself and some prestige for Labor(with no mention of the people of Australia) as well as having his mother in law as governor general and generally having no real leadership or toughness has made me very wary of going his way in 2 years. <br />I thought Abbot's lot I could put up with and learn to live with the things I knew that would come up that I wouldn't agree with. And stopping the boats and carbon tax was a decent start. But it really has been downhill ever since. His mention of changing the constitution to recognize one race over everyone else has lost me completely. <br />Turnbull always seemed to be a good moderate for followers of both parties. But the fact he has gone along with Abbot and seemed to justify all the crazy stuff, has probably ended his future chances at the top too. Its a sad state of affairs when there's no one to really vote for</p>

	<p>Quite right Grant... Mr Shorten has had an easy run and not done much at all with it. Is he playing for time while the Govt digs its own grave? Does he not have a responsibility to present a positive alternative?<br /><br />But what will we get with a Labor recovery and potential win in the next election? More party room factional dysfunction - the same rubbish as we have with the LNP.<br /><br />If we continue to stick with the same old two-party system and avoid taking our democratic responsibilities seriously (with lazy party voting), we do the same as the two parties and keep the governance of our dear old Aus in strife and conflict (the adversarial mismanagement of government).<br /><br />We NEED a fresh approach to politics. We NEED to ditch the two-party system and vote for independent candidates en masse.<br /></p>

	<p>good comment.<br /><br />I'd suggest a corrupting influence from the US via global corporations, pushing a certain ideology to conform with a global agenda for tea party style government. Sounds a bit like the IPA ?<br /><br />We need to completely cleanse the political system of all forms of corruption which will mean full disclosure of all funding and outlawing political lobbying, thinktanks who donate to political parties, union funding, and any other form of financial contribution which may influence the policies of any political parties. If we  don't do this, political parties will never represent the majority of the population. Let people donate as individuals with full official disclosure  and a personal limit on contribution (to say $100) so that no single person/business/union can exert an unfair proportion of influence on politics.<br /><br />Around 100 years ago there was a progressive party in the US which proposed full disclosure of political funding and while they had other great ideas, they were pushed out by the current powers that be because this party would have effectively removed their power. Since then the situation globally has worsened and our corporate, banking and resource industries becoming more blatent and completely  control politics everywhere.</p>

The ALP today resembles the misnamed &quot;Liberal Party&quot; of old more than the Australia Tea Party the liberals have morphed into!   Therefore, when the ALP gets in to government you get the old fashioned Liberal party!   The ALP slashed the public service, huge cuts to tertiary education, removal of tariffs, plenty of de-regulation, privatisation  etc etc.  What more could you ask for?</p>

	<p>There was no comment on Joe Hockey.He has done such a terrible job of selling the budget and the govt. initiatives. But the problem is that the govt. had no overarching philosophy and message and besides they are held captive by the outrageous statements they made prior to the election. I am not sure if its only Hockey's fault or Abbotts though. They need a circuit breaker and shuffling the decks will not cut it. I would suggest that Abbott be replaced by Turnbull as PM and that would give the new incumbent an opportunity to clear the decks. That may be a forlorn hope but I would hope that their backers in corporate board rooms would counsel them. This is destroying confidence .Just blaming it on Senate intransigence and the mess left by Labor is no solution. That is just a slogan with diminishing returns, when people stop listening to you.</p>

	<p>Yes, that's fine GP, but I can't see Turnbull going on with that thing that Abbot and Hockey call a budget.<br /><br />New PM, Treasurer, Speaker and a new budget document required. All of those afore mentioned plus about 10 people straight out of the ministry, onto the back benches.<br /><br />Then Mr Turnbull can start to convince the electorate of the LNP's intent.<br /><br />The term of government after this one is going to be a shocker.</p>

	<p>The problem is that Abbott himself is the heaviest lead weight in the coalition's saddlebags, so any dumped ministers are likely to become mutinous. Why should they be hung out to dry while the chief architect of the coalition's disastrous standing in the polls gets off scot free?<br /><br />And there is so much dead wood in both their ranks and in Abbott's office: Hockey, Pyne, Andrews, Dutton, Bronwyn Bishop, Credlin etc.<br /><br />This calls for a chain saw and a big change done in one hit over Christmas, but does Abbott have the guts to do it? He is now hated in the community and significant sections of his own party have had enough of him too. How much will it take for someone to challenge him as leader?<br /><br />These arrogant mediocrities threatened a lot at one time about double dissolutions - please bring it on, we can't wait to pay you back for your lies, unfairness, whining and excuses. If Abbott is still there at the next election all the better.</p>

	<p>Under Abbott's leadership the LNP won a decisive victory in the House of Reps. Had it not been for the actions of the preference whisperer, Abbott would be close to a majority in the Senate, with only the rapidly imploding PUP standing in the way. Now the terms of the Senate vote have been fixed to avoid a repeat of last year's rort. Assuming total disintegration of Palmer's political career and a Senate vote that favours the larger parties, the LNP may command the Upper House in 2016. So even if Bill Shorten becomes the first divorced person in the English-speaking world to achieve executive office, he may find that the Senate blocks his enlightened programme.<br /><br />Karma.</p>

	<p>As if the Liberals or any party for that matter will ever get a majority in the Senate. It's a proportional vote where the major and minor parties have equal footing, meanwhile the House of Reps is rigged in the major parties favor due to mandatory preferences.<br /><br />The only reason Howard took the Senate in 2004 was he swept up the imploded Democrats and there were no other parties to challenge the major ones (the Greens were still a single issue party)<br /><br />Even if PUP implodes (which I doubt) Lambie is here to stay, Xenophon is a legend in South Australia and the Greens primary vote keeps on increasing and there will be more diversity.<br /><br />Personally I see the Liberal Democrats in the Senate take a chunk out of the Liberal Party's libertarian voters now people know who they are. Social media is going to be a big driver of increased Senate diversity.<br /><br />And that's a good thing. Paul Keating dismissed the Senate as &quot;unrepresentative swill&quot;, I say it's the most representative picture of Australia we have.</p>

	<p>It's normal for young politicians to want the parliamentary seat. About 2 weeks after they first sit in the parliament, they see themselves in the ministry. It is the power that attracts them.<br /><br />A lot of political turmoil can come from young turks in positions beyond them, because somebody has to catch up the work that they thought was unimportant.<br /><br />It's a very rare young bird who is built for this kind of promotion. I think these youngsters have very little idea that the political job is about performing a decision making task for their electorate.<br /><br />In fact most members don't understand it. The Parties should not burden us with that sort of person.</p>

	<p>why would Abbott care what you think, after seeing some of your comments on here you would never vote for him. Abbott will do what Abbott does, in time he will lose an election and than we will have a labor government who will do what they do, and after a few years they will lose government and so the cycle runs. <br />The real question is how much debt and deficit is too much before it forces labor to finally admit (i use labor here because the coalition had admitted there is an issue) there is a problem that must be addressed.</p>

	<p>why would Abbott care what you think, after seeing some of your comments on here you would never vote for him. Abbott will do what Abbott does, in time he will lose an election and than we will have a labor government who will do what they do, and after a few years they will lose government and so the cycle runs. <br />The real question is how much debt and deficit is too much before it forces labor to finally admit (i use labor here because the coalition had admitted there is an issue) there is a problem that must be addressed.</p>

	<p>&quot;They (Abbott's ministry) were therefore familiar with how government works and had limited teething problems...&quot;<br />My GOD! This first year has been typified by blunders, about-faces, and rushed corrections. Imagine the mess if they had not kept that continuity!</p>

	<p>Conjecturing about Tony Abbott's moves now that he has attained the power that he has hankered for since the moment he first drew breathe, is an exercise in futility Paula.<br /><br />And given a personality that's spent it's life to date on the singular task of getting to the top, rather than contemplating what's necessary once one's got it, doesn't behave or react in ways that those who have contemplated what to do once the top spot has been got have concluded in their own minds needs doing;  writing such a piece represents nothing more than trying to earn a few bucks from writing words for the sake of writing words.<br /><br />To be honest; the media and the analysts the media loves to employ, ought to be as circumspect as the electorate when it comes to 'judgements' or coming up with premature conjecture.<br /><br />Just wait and see like the rest of us... or is that impossible for those who'd wet themselves from the nervous tension of having to wait for what will be revealed to be revealed?!</p>

	<p>The cynic in me says that the government could turn its fortunes around simply by changing its arrogant, aggressive, intransigent combative style that typifies front bench behaviour and leaves the electorate feeling time and again as though it's being made out to be the enemy.<br /><br />To achieve this may well necessitate the dumping of the worst offenders, notably Morrison,  Pyne, Cormann, Hockey,  Dutton, Johnson,  Bishop and Abbott.</p>

	<p>If the government changes direction for the good of the community/nation, then that's OK by me however it comes to &quot;see the light&quot;, but if it changes simply to protect itself from (further) electoral damage, then  it's not, especially when the new is really the old rebadged to look different.  Last week's changes to medicare are a case in point.</p>

	<p>I don't get it.   I don't think our Government really wanted to be involved in war.  But at the same time they have to balance all the issues - such as all the international relationships involved, the impact of doing nothing (nice for us but awful for many people) and the future impact of doing nothing.   A terrorist group unchallenged is likely to grow into a much bigger problem.   All of human history is peppered with violence, it will not go away by turning a blind eye to it.   Personally, I don't want to be involved either but I trust our Government (both Labor and Liberal) to consider all the factors (and most I wouldn't be privy to) and make a decision.</p>

	<p>Nothing will save this government.  They are a national disgrace taking us to war because of what?  I honestly don't know.  It terrorises me the way coalition handles the country like there's no tomorrow.  Bulldozes everything they can't solve.  You have to think 'no wonder'.   Reshuffle what???  I just don't think running a nation is the same as shuffling a pack of cards.  We don't stand a chance with the coalition in power.  Vote them out.

	<p>Virtually every minister in the Abbott Govt. has performed very poorly in the first year &amp; one of the poorest performers has been the PM.<br />The MYEFO has been released today &amp; from what I have seen so far there is nothing there to bring in more revenue other than to bash the old dented drum that they have all the necessary policies in place, like what?. If they are talking about the $5 Medicare co-payment, university deregulation, cancelling dole payments for under 30's, unless in an education scheme then they will continue to reap the wrath of the electorate.<br /></p>

	<p>Paula, the problem is, Abbott is a pugilist at heart. It's all about winners and losers and nothing else. <br /><br />Doing the sensible thing and reshuffling the pack would, to Abbott, be akin to defeat, an admission that he was wrong in the first place. <br /><br />The party could, of course, force him to make changes. But, then Abbott would, to save face, simply deny that the changes had been made.<br /><br />I don't think we need any more weirdness, to be honest. <br /><br />The last thing the Australian public needs is to have the PM stand up at a press conference insisting that new Treasurer Malcolm Turnbull is actually Joe Hockey.</p>

	<p>I'm wondering if Abbott is deliberately trying to antagonize Julie Bishop into resigning her position as Foreign Minister. It appears to be the only reason for all the moves that he's made against her over the past month. He certainly can't demote her based upon performance because, out of all the ministers in the cabinet, she appears to have the most runs on the board. <br /></p>

	<p>Hahahaha... It's true but is a very negative statement all the same.   There's no excuses for negativity.  So will you be extremely negative or extremely positive?  You know when you have a struck a balance it can only mean you are deeply unconscious.  If I had to choose one extreme over the other, I would choose being extremely positive.  Particularly if it involves tax payers money!  Some people call it being responsible.</p>

	<p>Paula forgets that the only reason we have 'stability' in Coalition ranks is that Abbott can't sack or demote his key ministers caught in the travel rort or other scandals without condemning himself.<br />Howard would have sacked the lot like he did Senator Jim Short, Senator Brian Gibson, Senator Bob Woods, MP  Geoff Prosser, MP David Jull, MP John Sharp, MP Peter McGauran,  Sen. Ian Campbell and Sen. Santo Santoro. <br />In 11 years Howard's reshuffles led to 7 different Ministers for Employment and workplace Relations, 5 different Transport Ministers, 4 different Education Ministers, 3 different Immigration Ministers, 3 different Health Ministers, 3 different Trade Ministers</p>

	<p>I'd say that Paula's assertion that Abbott &amp; Co have stagnated is virtually axiomatic, given that this government is stuck in an ideological time warp and simply cannot frame any policy or any statement outside of the confines of the usual rubbish.   It follows that any reshuffle will achieve nothing more than reshuffling a 52 card deck which only contains deuces and jokers....</p>

	<p>After doing a river dance stomp over pensioners, disabled, carers, unemployed, students, asylum seekers, muslims/islams, privacy &amp; freedom advocates, workers health, doctors, fuel buyers, scientists, climate change advocates, soldiers etc etc etc there's no one left that cares whether or not they now want to shuffle.<br /><br />A PM who's either on holiday err overseas trips or building up his suntan on the beach or at sport games.  A solitary female in cabinet that gets a posting sure to keep her overseas.  A budget that managed to upset &amp; detrimentally affect all voters.  A $ that's plummeted from above parity with US$ to 82 cents - oh yes they tell us that's suppose to be good (only good if we actually are still making stuff). A set of treatment policies for asylum seekers that make the Guantanamo Bay's look good. Dragging us yet again into a war in Iraq that has finally brought terrorism to our shores.    If I didn't know better I'd think this cabinet was trying to murder the LNP.<br /><br />This party was elected to lead a tango not sit like a wallflower hoping something will come up so they can say something other than for the hundredth plus time &quot;the mess Labor left us with&quot;.  They deserve to be ousted for the contempt they've shown to Aussies intelligence by repeating everything a hundred times over.<br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>Doesn't matter if they change the salesman while the product is the same.<br /><br />Are these 'young guns' going to stop the destruction of civil society? Are they going to reinstate expert advise that contradicts the puerile propaganda of the IPA? Do they realise that taking from the poor and giving to the rich destroys the economy? Will they espouse educated policy instead of three word slogans? <br /><br />Until the Coalition reasserts evidenced based policies instead of lies, smears and fear campaigns there is no hope for them. While we are under the unholy trinity of faith based policy that worships a vengeful God, The Invisible Hand and Mammon, there will be no hope for us.</p>

	<p>A government is just like a large corporation. The leader decides the paths how things are going to happen. For that to happen, he (almost always a he) will hand pick the amigos he believe can carry out his wishes. It is no co-incidence that those lucky amigos always harbour the same mind sets, the same ideology. <br /><br />That is not a bad situation if things do work out. However, it is like putting all the eggs in one basket. If there are no alternative views, when things go pear shape, it can go horribly wrong as there is no plan-B.<br /><br />Yes, it is the economy, stupid! Joe Hockey was given the most important portfolio as the treasurer. Straight away, he began to dump on Wayne Swan. He reckoned that he can do a much better job than Swan. His agenda was to cut, cut and cut. More cuts than the negatives cutting room. One cannot proceed to make major changes without a &quot;theme&quot;. For him, it is the &quot;budget emergency&quot;, &quot;budget black-hole&quot;, &quot;leaners and lifters&quot;, &quot;The age of entitlements is over&quot;. <br /><br />All sounded good and impressive. So he and Corrman went into hiding and produced a budget that will cure all economic ills. To celebrate they uber achievement, they lit a couple of fat cigars (imported from Cuba?). Unfortunately for them, that was perhaps the last joyful moment for them. After that, it was all uphill, and pushing a wheelbarrow full of crap.<br /><br />There are times one needs to shut the f up and get on with it. Joe didn't do that. He was whinging about the windmills being utterly offensive. I mean, whatever did the windmills do to him? The he delivered a couple of golden quotes. &quot;Poor people don't drive&quot;. With one simple stroke, he upset nearly half the population...Well, perhaps three quarter now? Then he carried on about emergency and black-holes as if scaring people is a lot of fun.<br /><br />As recent as a couple of days ago, he turned to car mechanics. He talking about &quot;shock absorbers&quot; Apparently his budget is now a shock absorber! Most people don't use the term &quot;shock absorber&quot;, &quot;SHOCKERS&quot; is the preferred one.<br /><br />Yes, a &quot;SHOCKER&quot; of a budget, Joe. <br /><br />I think Ms. Matthewson is being very kind to point to the pool of experience within the cabinet. Well, that may be so. However, a minister with 20 years experience could well be 1 year experience 20 times! Same all over again 20 times. Did anyone notice how quiet it is? George Brandis, Kevin Andrews, Eric Abetz seemed to have gone mute !<br /><br />I wonder what JULIAN Gillard is thinking right now?</p>

	<p>Tea Sexy Fingers just goes from blunder to another.  I thing the today's Morgan Gallop Poll says it all:<br />ALP support surged to 57.5% (up 4%) now well ahead of the L-NP 42.5% (down 4%) on a two-party preferred basis this weekend. This is the ALP?s biggest lead since early June 2014. If a Federal Election were held now the ALP would win easily according to this week?s Morgan Poll on voting intention conducted with an Australia-wide cross-section of 3,007 Australian electors aged 18+ over the last two weekends.<br />Let those who support hose who are behind bring out the cracked record &quot;the only poll that matters is on voting day&quot; correct, but this is disasterous for one term tony and his his nitwits.</p>

	<p>&quot;No less than 20 in Abbott's ministry served in the last ministry of the Howard government. &quot;<br /><br />Is it any wonder that the Government is already appearing stale.  Although the Libs try and pretend that the 2007 election result was an aberration as the remove all trace of the ALP governments.<br /><br />Reality Slap: The Howard Government and its Ministers were voted out for a reason.  Thanks for bringing back the core and non core promises, but keeping faith with the big three, repeal the carbon tax, repeal the mining tax, stopping the boats, and the supplementary - repairing the budget.<br />How is that last one going?</p>

	<p>It's a little tedious the way the ABC wants to portray this government as being as dysfunctional as, well every Labor government there has ever been. But it is not it is cool calm collected, consistent functional and effective. Everything a Labor government can never be.<br /><br />But you sorry few who come to The Drum to talk amongst yourselves to pretend that the majority of Australia agrees with you, live in your isolated ABC bubble like dementia  patients at an aged care facility.</p>

	<p>Hi Nell.  The ABC provides an outlet, it does not direct discussion.  <br /><br />By the way, I believe the polls support the view that the majority of Australia does not regard the current Government as much more than an extremely bad joke.</p>

	<p>Today, you can tell a book by its cover.<br /><br />Look at Abbotts F-Grade motley crew, I mean, really, they are wholly unrepresentative of Australians - old, disconnected, backward-thinking, self-interested, wilful hardline conservatives. <br /><br />Abbotts front bench are his political mates, he owes them, they owe him and they're Australias 'Team failure'. <br /><br />As for replacements - Abbotts inherent vindictiveness and prejudices permeates his Tea Party LNP whether they are 30 or 80.<br /><br />If the LNP cannot modernise and reflect Australias youth &amp; dynamism. they should leave the room.<br /><br />Millions of Australians see no future in flat-earth, climate deniers, small government without social responsibility, greed before people and the reckless pursuit of power.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>I just don't trust this Coalition Government, no matter what changes to the front bench we see. With the exception of the Member from Shepparton who stood up early about SPC and doubted the words of Abbott none have questioned Abbott and his lies, instead we have seen apologies for his deliberate, deceiving and downright dishonest word. As long as they remain in Parliament I will never, never trust the word of a Liberal/National Party Politician. Liars all of them. Abbott is by far the worst I have seen in my long lifetime. Re shuffle as much as you like. Never, never will I trust Abbott or his apologists. I distrust him so much, during yesterdays terrible incident, whenever I saw his face, I refused to listen or watch him and changed the channel, he can't be trusted or relied on to be truthful or sincere.</p>

	<p>Totally agree.<br /><br />Our family &amp; friends also push mute should he or his cronies appear on screen.<br /><br />Whats it going to take for Abbott to be totally discredited? His immorality knows no bounds and few msm hold him to account.<br /><br />Abbott lies 'the buck stops with me', then crab-crawls away and hides in his office. He only pops out when hes grandstanding, lying or because hes no choice. <br /><br />Australia is in a very bad situation socially, economically &amp; environmentally and mug Abbott misinforms, manipulates and divides our communities with the nod from his cronies, shock jocks and aggressively partisan media supporters.<br /><br />Millions strongly believe Tony Abbott represents the worst human qualities.</p>
