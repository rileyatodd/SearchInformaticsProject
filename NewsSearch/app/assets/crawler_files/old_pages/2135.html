       MYEFO will be our best indication yet of whether the Abbott Government has learnt its lesson about its budget. <span class="source">(AAP: Dean Lewins)</span>

  <p><strong><em>The real test of the Treasurer</em></strong><em>'<strong>s MYEFO mini budget won't be the size of the forecast deficit, but its targets for raising revenue, writes Greens leader Christine Milne.</strong></em></p><p>With the release of the mid-year economic forecast today, commentators and pundits alike will be watching keenly to see if Treasurer Joe Hockey and Prime Minister Tony Abbott have learnt anything at all from the last six months of chaos and disaster borne of their cruel budget.</p><p>To date we've only seen political posturing and tinkering around the edges of failed policies. Desperate attempts to breathe life into twice-dead reforms are all about saving face and a phoney commitment to fixing a debt crisis that everyone else accepts does not exist.</p><p>Tony Abbott's Government has failed to grasp that without a substantial realignment of priorities for raising revenue to fund vital services and infrastructure, the Australian people and the parliament they elected will reject their cruel budget measures again, and again, and again.</p><p>The Australian people have seen straight through the magician's tricks in Mr Hockey's budget. The "look over here" distractions of a temporary deficit levy and medical research fund didn't fool anyone. When viewed in the context of brutal and permanent cuts elsewhere, they are little more than smoke and mirrors.</p><p>The budget is seen for what it is: a blatant cash grab from those who can least afford to pay in order to let the big end of town off the hook. It offends fundamental Australian values that we all deserve a fair go no matter where we live or the circumstances in which we find ourselves.</p><p>Australians have also rejected Mr Hockey's special pleading that there are no alternatives. It is a lie. With the banks, polluters, miners and the big end of town raking in billions in under-taxed profit and subsidies, the argument that we should put the onus on students, the unemployed and sick to "fix the budget" is seen for what it is - a con job.</p><p>It is disappointing then, that the Labor Opposition has failed to help expose the "no alternative" lie by keeping its head down and not proposing its own revenue alternatives as the Greens have done. Bill Shorten has taken a lesson from Mr Abbott's playbook in this regard. But never mind, the Australian people have cottoned on regardless.</p><p>Australians get it. They want more than lip service about corporate tax avoidance, they want action and to see the tax dollars flow in to fund better schools and hospitals. They demand more than token temporary levies on the mega rich, they want to create a more caring and equal society with revenue raised from the people who can afford it. The Greens' fully costed policies to this end would raise almost $70 billion.</p><p>MYEFO will be our best indication yet of whether the Abbott Government has learnt its lesson.</p><p>While some economists will be looking straight to the bottom line, the real test of Mr Hockey's mini budget won't be the size of the forecast deficit, but its targets for raising revenue to fund the services and support Australians deserve.</p><p>If the Abbott Government fails to drop its born-to-rule mentality and continues to try to browbeat the Senate to pass its cruel budget, it is doomed to fail itself. When we look to its targets for revenue raising, we'll know where the new budget will end up.</p><p><em>Christine Milne is the Australian Greens Leader and Senator for Tasmania.

	<h3 class="">massive distract:</h3>
	<p class="date">15 Dec 2014 1:44:07pm</p>
	<p>The government have certainly learned one lesson very well - when everything they're trying to push through seems doomed, a massive &quot;distraction&quot; (preferably involving a national disaster, terror, or emergency) can work wonders for their fortunes... <br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting for a moment that they'd actively coordinate something like that or even consciously wish for it. <br /><br />... but co-incidentally, such a terrible incident that delays the release of the MYEFO announcement does give Hockey the opportunity to pull a Rabbit out of a hole.

	<p>Sadly, the first thing I thought when I heard the news break is &quot;what essential liberties will we lose now?&quot; The Abbott Government ran rough shod over our freedom when there had been not one single terrorist attack on Australian soil. Can you imagine what they will do with this? ASIO/AFP and other institutions that I now see as enemies of Australian values will be licking their lips. Absolute, unchecked power is a step closer and they know it. And I am not jumping for the tin foil hat, but if the AFP want to assume every Australian is potentially a criminal, shouldn't that assumption extend to AFP/ASIO etc. In fact, I think it more likely that 20 odd year AFP rookie is morte likely to go &quot;rogue&quot; than Esme the 95 yo down the road.<br /><br />The heads of the AFP/ASIO would not do anything to cause this to occur, but wishing in the abstract for an &quot;incident&quot; from which to leverage more power...I have no doubt about it. Watch our freedoms perish in the coming months WITH public approval and you'll see what I mean.</p>

	<p>I am one who entirely rejects her analysis.<br /><br />If Australians wanted higher taxes and higher spending we would have voted Greens/ALP. This Government's problems are that is has not cut spending and has raised taxes. I will applaud the Government if they cut Foreign Aid further. We cannot afford it. All the Lefties on here bang on about the Scandinavian countries as poster boys for socialism - I bet they do not waste so much on Foreign Aid as we do - I have no knowledge on the subject so perhaps someone can give me stats - but considering their net surpluses, they should be paying far more per capita than Australia - and the US should spend zero on Foreign Aid. Actually, when I look at the books, Norway should be sending Aid to the US - but I digress.<br /><br />But the reason Christine and I will never be able to reconcile our points of view is summarised in her use of six little words - &quot;from those that can afford it&quot;. I prefer &quot;from those who use it&quot;. Should my new couch be paid for by &quot;someone who can afford it&quot; or by &quot;those whose posteriors will adorn it&quot; What of that marble staircase I wanted? If Christine and others who can afford it are now paying for everything, I need to go see an interior decorator. And I will hand in my resignation, thank you very much. <br /><br />I note that Christine admits that the Greens see those on over $180k pa are now MEGA RICH - she was criticising the deficit levy as a temporary impost on the &quot;mega rich&quot;. So that is why I need that marble staircase urgently - I am mega rich! Woohoo. Let's go on a holiday...wait a sec there's stuff all in my account...but Christine said I was mega rich. Oh, I forgot, SOMEONE ELSE foots the bills for things I want...then I foot the bill for things others want...I get it. But won't that lead to a situation like trading gifts at Christmas - everyone pays for something but rarely receives what they want because we cannot read each other?s minds? And won't people just choose lavishly because they are not responsible for those bills. How many readers on here are more extravagant with a hotel's A/C than the one at home?<br /><br />As to the Corporate's like Google/Apple. It's simple. An individual Government cannot do anything about another Government (like Ireland) undercutting the corporate tax rate. I know the Greens don't know much about business - but if you try to introduce a special tax on them - they do have the option of not doing business here. In fact, China told Google to start censoring content if they wanted to do business in China. Google politely declined the offer and chose not to do business there. <br /><br />I am still waiting for my marble staircase, Christine. It's really is hard to find good help these days.<br /></p>

The fact is, that if Milne and her fellow travellers from outer space ever get their hands on the keys. there will no 'big end of town' because they will be taxed right out of the country and then what Christine?</p>

	<p>What a load of BS Todd. Milne never said those on $180,000 are the mega rich. She correctly noted that the mega rich are paying a temporary levy whilst cuts to social welfare, pensions and such are permanent. Yours is just a straw man argument to distract. By the way I am on over $180K and just like you I am doing very well indeed. Consider the average income in Australia is $45K then you need to grow up. I will guarantee your superannuation tax benefits alone will outweigh anything a pensioner receives from this government. You are one of those that has become so used to middle income welfare that you see it as an entitlement. You, like myself are not entitled and I suggest you pay your way before deriding others.</p>

	<p>&quot;That might depend on whether you're talking before or after tax, harry.&quot;<br /><br />What does that even mean?<br />Super tax concessions are clearly a discount to normal tax, the benefit is the reduction in tax. The initial $25k isn't a gift from the government, it is an individual's income.<br /><br />A pension is money given from government revenue directly to an individual.<br /><br />As usual you have no idea what you are talking about.</p>

	<p>&quot;Norway should be sending Aid to the US - but I digress.&quot;<br /><br />Well actually Todd there is an organisation in  the UK not Norway that sends doctors and medical staff to nations that cannot cope when it comes to medical emergencies and a failing health system. And guess what Todd. The good ole USA has been the recipient of these services for medical treatment for a large number of their citizens from these volunteer medical groups in the UK for over a decade now. <br /><br />Now Todd doesn't that at least inform you that if you trash the Medicare system and promoted privatised medical insurance  schemes that maybe might not be that appropriate for the majority of Australians.  Just a case in point that the illustrious Abbott government under the unquestionable auspices of Mathias Cormann has just sold off the only publicly owned medical insurer Medibank Private.  Of course we don't have to put up the poster boys of Scandinavia and Finland all the time but you Right wing reactionaries always revert to your favourite Greece.  Now do you think the socialists amongst us would follow Greece or Scandinavia and Finland? Mute question really.<br /><br /><br />But the UK is not Scandinavia and Finland. True but even under the Tories the UK would not touch and nor would the majority of its citizens allow it to fiddle with the NHS. But here in Abbott land it is open slather  &quot;Free Market&quot; vandalism of the last remaining vestiges in Australia of anything that is publicly owned. Now that's real good planning for future generations under the guise of paying down debt. Well you can only sell these publicly owned assets once. <br /><br />And if you have any inkling of economics to the community as opposed to economics for wealthy individuals then you would be aware that although selling off public assets is good for the government the onus then falls back onto citizens who end up paying the private sector more for a worse service. So cost the government less but citizens more. Unless of course you are only worried about your share portfolio like the wealthy who gain pleasure from profit and glee at the expense of suffering by the majority of citizens. <br /><br />Greed is Good.</p>

	<p>$5 per visit. I wish. I am $70 light per visit and I think I get about $30 back. But that is in Perth. Many doctors do not bulk bill at all, and many more only do so for concession holders. But such shortages are a direct result of &quot;fiscal equalization&quot; under the GST...something that is killing WA. And &quot;fiscal equalization&quot; was signed off by Court , a LIBERAL premier and Howard, a LIBERAL PM. I have my own beliefs, I do not blindly follow any particular party. Obviously, I vote LDP, so it is only my second preference that counts. I believe in freedom and individual choice. I then support whichever party best reflects those principles. Not the other way around. And taxes are a polite form of slavery. That is, if you were taxed at 100%, you would be working for no pay. Obviously, some taxes are necessary, but I think our taxes are too high, along with our Government spending. But I respect your point of view, however I do not share it.</p>

	<p>Todd I beg to differ on this part of your post. Its not correct at all when compared to other OECD nations.<br /><br /> &quot;Obviously, some taxes are necessary, but I think our taxes are too high, along with our Government spending. But I respect your point of view, however I do not share it.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Australia pays lower levels of tax than most other OECD nations.&quot; source ABC 8th May 2014.<br /><br />Voicing her support for a &quot;deficit levy&quot; on higher income earners, Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) chief executive Cassandra Goldie told ABC Radio's AM program Australia needs to strengthen its tax base. &quot;Clearly revenue is a problem, we're still one of the lowest taxing countries in the OECD,&quot; Dr Goldie said on April 29.<br /><br />source ABC 8th May 2014.<br /><br />BTW it doesn't matter whose quote it is . The quote is quite correct concerning Australia's low taxing rates.<br /><br />As for Court and Howard and WA's GST. Well it was all worked out by the Conservatives and Barnett made a lot of noise when it was a Labor government and he makes a bit of noise now but its all puff and absolutely no action. You can always rely on Barnett to back his fellow Conservatives in Canberra ahead of WA's needs. I think Barnett is a bit light on when he hasn't got a commanding position. That I'm sure about.</p>

	<p>Hey, mate. We have different points of view. But if you are better educated than I, you should know hat the use of an ad hominem is a sign of a lack of counter argument. but by raise revenue you do mean take money off others - others that have worked for that money in the case of personal income tax. I do not class guys who work for a living as rich. Maybe look up the history of the term &quot;working class&quot; to better understand my point of view. But your point of view is valid as it is but opinion as is my view. But for all I have read on Keynes et al, I have never heard of increasing taxes to avoid depression...but it has been nearly 20 years since I did an intro Econs unitar Uni, so I will not categorically state that no economist has ever suggested it. PS - I don't think anyone on here is a blithering idiot - that's not how the Drum rolls (see what I did there). Just people with differing opinions. That's why I love the Drum and the ABC more broadly. Trust me, mate, Abbott will pay for his cuts to the ABC. A bad move no matter how you slice it.</p>

	<p>Tradesmen? I do not have that good a disposable income - and I assume THAT is why you assume they wouldn't work for me. I used the term &quot;help&quot; to mock the attitude of entitlement. My point is that you should not have your labour taxed to provide for others (unless you volunteer, of course) in what I see as polite master/servant relationship between a worker and the taxman. That is, you work and someone else gets the fruits of your effort. If people want to give more to those less fortunate, by all means, but it should not be compelled of workers. Tax is a necessary evil that should only be for necessities and be as light a burden as possible.<br /><br />Um, more people in fact did put the Liberal/National coalition (or the LNP in some places) as first preference. More than any other party. But I am not a cheerleader for either outfit. It happens to be that I agree with Liberal economic policies more than that of Labor/Greens. On balance, I don't like what the Abbott Government has done. Anyway the first preference split was roughly 45/33/9 rounded to nearest %. So 45 to 42 if you call the de facto set up the ALP have with the Greens a coalition. <br /><br />For the record, I agree more with Greens/Labor on non-economic social policy but that's not relevant to Christine's article. Basically, I like freedom and individual choice. So I support things like gay marriage - as long as I don't cop a special tax to provide for the ceremony.</p>

	<p>While ever we have the leaders we have, the political and economic system will never change.<br /><br />Sadly while I agree with your article, mainstream politics attracts so many people with narcissistic and psychotic mind sets, and while those are admirable assets in the right setting, it makes for the type of policies currently being proffered by the LNP.<br /><br />Even more sad is that the ALP is not far behind the LNP. I thought there was hope for a while, but political point scoring and massive ego became more important than Australia.<br /><br />Christine, if the Greens have SERIOUS alternatives for this country, you need to pound the pavement at every level and urgently and loudly let us know what the details of your policies are. <br /><br />Give us a seriously viable option at election time, or the Greens just might miss their golden opportunity too.</p>

	<p>Yes. There are probably two major stumbling blocks: 1) further towards the environment than most people are willing to go, and 2) a refugee policy that will see many many more refugees coming in.<br /><br />It seems to me that problem with refugees is a global problem, and the only way it can be managed is by a global solution. Hand the arrivals, and most of the money we are spending over to the UNHCER. All asylum seekers are distributed to UN camps all over the world, Australia has a quota from these camps. If the UNHCER doesn't want to come to the table, we officially walk away from the refugee treaty (which we are breaking anyway).</p>

	<p>Yes overpopulation is a huge problem. Stopping the demonisation, judgement and restriction of access to abortion for women who seek abortions might be a good place to start, sadly not too many men are doing much about weighing in to that debate in a progressive way because it is framed as a 'feminist' issue rather than a human issue which comes about as a result of the actions of TWO people.<br /><br />People could be advocating for contraception and abortion to be more accessible for both women and men the world over, but they instead prefer to immerse themselves in tit for tat moral debates about foetal personhood rather than the reality that vast amounts of children are being born in to poverty in an environment that is increasingly unable to sustainably support them. <br /><br />People could be fighting for more contraceptive choices for men in order to both give men true control over their own reproductive choices as well as dramatically reduce the birth rate, but unfortunately you have to get people to GENUINELY care first rather than just pay some cheap lip service to the issue, which is the hard part.</p>

	<p>I agree Jay.<br />I agree with what you say about handing the responsibility completely to the UNHCER.<br />I don't think it's a brilliant solution by any means however I can't see any other course of action.<br />Mostly what I'm hearing from ordinary Australians in my area is that they don't want refugees here, esp ones from Muslim countries, because they are concerned that our country may end up like the one they left behind.<br />We can argue till the cows come home about whether that is correct or not but that is what most Australians seem to be saying they want.<br />So, in light of that, I think the whole situation needs to be handled by the UNHCER, worldwide, and at least that'll stop it being a political football.<br />Christine, if you're listening, I believe a lot of people would vote for the Greens in the next election if you followed Jay's recommendation. <br />I'm hearing that your policy on this issue is the only thing holding them back.<br />Food for thought anyway.</p>

	<p>Halve immigration, double refugees.<br /><br />We are increasing the population of Australia by 300,000 per year. That is too many for existing infrastructure but big business loves it. To distract from the hundreds of thousands of economic refugees being invited in to keep wages low and real estate prices high, they have to demonise refugees and claim they are the ones swamping us. Smoke and mirrors.</p>

	<p>Lo, the Greens have no clue about economics. They say &quot;we'll get all the money from the big guys and everyone (of course) thinks that is great. Why do you think NO GOVERNMENT HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO DO IT? Because that same big business will just up and leave. Besides, governments see benefits beyond the tax take. Take Ireland, who has attracted all the mulitnationals with their 10% tax rate. But they get the benefits of at least having the extra consumer demand, extra employment etc where they do collect taxes. The sad fact is that since Ireland have reduced the tax to less than a third of our Company Tax Rate, their economy has been on the improve (albeit from a low base). And you might be able to convince Ireland to stop that with a lot of effort, but it becomes like whack-a-mole, in that another country will pop it's hand up.</p>

	<p>Yes, those mining companies are just going to go to Ireland. Let them mine Irelands natural resources then. I'm pretty sure Australians would be happy for nationalized mines and 100% of mining resources to go back into the pockets of Australians. <br /><br />The Greens policies are all fully costed by independent analysis. The Greens have the backing of several major economists. It was the Greens at the last election who had the only economically sound policies that put Australia back in the black. <br /><br />The idea that the orthodox Keynesian Greens are &quot;Crazy&quot; just shows how far-right the economic debate has become, where indicators are now reaching back to the mid 19th century globally in inequality and wealth.</p>

	<p>How many people are investing in Australia at the moment? Last time I looked, the Economy has almost frozen.<br /><br />The &quot;Holy market&quot; will invest anywhere where there is demand. People will invest in Australia if Australian resources were given back to the Australian public, boosting consumer confidence through the roof and high tech infrastructure for Business to build upon. <br /><br />Many countries have nationalized their resources. Venezuela was in an even worse position before Chavez I've noticed right wingers conveniently forget. Except then, millions more were living in abject poverty without even access to water.<br />Venezuela isn't unique. It's problems are matched by essentially every other developing nation with a two speed resource based economy.</p>

	<p>I thought they were talking about Google, Apple etc. Our mining companies pay the same rate, 30%, as does any Australian company. If you think the Greens would approve one new mine, you are optimistic to the point of na?vet?. The Greens are against mining. You just have to read between the lines, mate. Extraction of a non-renewable resource is not sustainable under our current understanding of the laws of physics. So, a new mine comes up for approval. The greens say &quot;sorry, it is not sustainable&quot; as it has a life of, say, thirty years. Therefore, it is unsustainable.<br /><br />Agriculture is a bit harder as that is sustainable in a technical sense, but they would knock that on the head too, mate. Did you know the Greens were originally an environmentalist movement? I only ask because they blocked the ETS and the re-indexation of the fuel excise. And how many times have you seen an environmentalist urging that a parcel of land be cleared for crops or grazing? There is a reason that those living on the land do not vote Greens. Or would you know more about what the Greens would mean for regional Australia than those that work the land? It is OK, to support the Greens. It is OK to be against mining and agriculture. But I find it a little dishonest for you to say the Greens would not harm mining and agriculture. And I do not how they could stymie two of our biggest industries, increase spending in pretty much all areas and still get us back int he black? I didn't believe the Libs could get us out of the Labor/Greens debt as they announced no major spending cuts and they promised no new taxes. But they were the most credible as they do not see business as the enemy (ALP) or development as the enemy (Greens). However, the Abbott Government has belied the ideals of the Liberal Party and increased or introduced new taxes and has done precious little on cutting spending. In fact, they have increased the cost of doing business with say the metadata retention that will be paid for by anyone using the Internet. Their cuts to Foreign Aid ought to be applauded, however.</p>

I think you are shooting from the hip.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Ireland have reduced the tax to less than a third of our Company Tax Rate, their economy has been on the improve (albeit from a low base).&quot; <br /><br />That's why Premier Barnett made a deal with Ireland when the mining boom was going to be able to access labour from Ireland on a more favourable deal to the Irish. Now guess what Todd. Why do you think so many Irish folk wanted to come to WA and for all accounts and purposes are still coming and emigrating as fast as they can. <br /><br />BTW I have had more than one conversation with Irish expats and you know what they tell me Todd. &quot;That the economy in Ireland is screwed&quot; Other words its been in free fall and melt down ever since the GFC albeit with a few small gains in some very limited circumstances. Property and housing crashed and never recovered. Nor did jobs or the economy in Ireland to date.</p>

	<p>Sorry, mate. I should not have used the phrase &quot;albeit from a low base&quot;. What that means is they were screwed and now they are less screwed. Just as we are still blessed with a good economy today, but things are getting worse, like our terms of trade. But you are slightly correct. Their tax rate is 12.5% ours is 30%. Should have said &quot;a little over a third&quot;. But the point is that capital is fickle and goes wherever it likes. Gee, I mean some companies are moving from China to Bangladesh or Vietnam as see China as relatively high cost. Crazy, I know. But we are part of the problem. I want to buy my things for as low a price as possible. And so do many others evidently. What can be done to stop capital moving to a jurisdiction with what even I see as too low a company tax rate? Nothing. No one nation can stop them because they do not have jurisdiction. The only way that could be fixed would be with a World Government. I know you Lefties THINK you would want a World Government, but I do not. just watch, mate. Labor/Greens will get in in 2016 and they won't be able to do a damn thing about it. They could drive the companies out of Australia, but how would that help? It would only reduce the tax take.</p>

They used to call it the Celtic Tiger, now they just call it stuffed.<br /><br />Time for all countries to work together to get the rampaging corporations to pay their share. They are in Australia to make money. They are not 'investing' out of the good of their hearts. While they still make money and get the ordinary cost of business deductions then they can stay. If they use the various accounting tricks to pay no tax then they can go away and we will all be better for their absence. <br /><br />A new set of tariffs based on the tax level of the country they are parked in.

	<p>Well, I don't normally agree with the &quot;fairies at the bottom of the garden&quot;, but this government has a nasty elitist tone to its behaviour across a range of areas.  The impression is of a bunch of US frat boys pulling the wings off flies in between cigars and drinks.  John Howard's government was accused of being &quot;tricky and mean&quot;.  With respect to this government, it should read &quot;tricky, mean and dumb&quot;.  <br /><br />I remember that the then Opposition used to taunt Julia Gillard for her lack of &quot;retail&quot; political skills.  Well, she has nothing at all to learn from this crew.  Tony and Joe, you should go back to Sydney University and do a couple of refresher units in political science and economics (maybe marketing as well).  <br /><br />I shudder to say it, but Christine Milne is right.  The Government should start turning their (apparently limited) intellects towards revenue raising.  I'm sure that I'd disagree with the Greens regarding the mix of revenue raising approaches, but they're right in principle.</p>

	<p>Tony Abbott, great builder of castles in the sky, is the creator par excellence of fairies at the bottom of the garden. <br /><br />Of course the Govt needs to turn what intellect it can muster (its own may be limited, but it does have some very clever people on whom it can call) towards revenue raising.  To date it has been engaged in a great bonanza of forgoing revenue, to polluters and to the already wealthy.  <br /><br />But it also should be thinking about the industries of the future.  Fossil fuels may provide some crucial components for new products, but burning them with gay abandon in the old way will not be a foothold for the industries of the future.<br /><br />John Hewson's piece that appeared this morning is a good complement to this, all the better for being using more neutral language.  It asks for the vision of a path to the future.  It is the total absence of an evident vision that is the really damning aspect of this govt's performance.   Or if they have a vision, they would tell us before the election, and still they are not saying.<br /><br />But hey, Christine Milne is a politician, and needs colour to get her message across.</p>

	<p>Australia's birthrate is already below replacement and our population would be shrinking without immigration. Limiting natural population growth in Australia is a solved problem, in fact there is every likelihood that global population will peak below 10 billion and may even decline below current levels by 2100.<br /><br />This is a good thing but we need to start planning right now for a post-growth high-automation future because that is what we are going to have to deal with.<br /></p>

Superior technology is where we're at/heading and removing the science minister does far more to damaging security than a stable population policy.<br /><br />The Greens should take a stable population policy to an election.

	<p>Are you high? Tell me what you reasonably think could be achieved by the Greens on overpopulation. Really, I'd love to hear it.<br /><br />Should they continually hound the government to tell the UN that it needs to become a global abortion machine? Force the rest of theWorld to adopt China's one child policy?<br /><br />There are soooooo many things that we need to do or change already, things that are within our power to change.<br /><br />Overpopulation is a strawman deflection, in this instance. It is something that will have to be dealt with when we have the maturity to solve other, easier (yet still monumental) problems, or it will be &quot;solved&quot; with oceans of blood. Crying foul of the Greens not tackling it ignores reality far more than the Greens are usually blamed for.</p>

	<p>Strawman. What are two majors going to do about overpopulation, apart from hoping that it continues unabated for that glorious buzzword: growth?<br /><br />I know of a socialist country that has a one child policy. Are you saying that the Greens should try and emulate them? How well do you think that would go? <br /><br />It's also another problem that requires global action. Getting people to stop polluting is hard. Forcing the entire World to stop having children is obviously impossible in the current geopolitical climate. And to use the excuse of not doing anything on CC: our population is proportionally minuscule. What could Australia really do about it?<br /><br />And, finally, it is our continued short-sighted overconsumption that needs to be curbed. Overpopulation is a huge problem, but pretending that that is the only one worth doing anything about, is both naive and dangerous whilst our bad habits continue.</p>

	<p>Repeat after me (and then go look up some good economics textbooks): a government is not like a person with a mortgage. <br /><br />When you live forever, can pass laws that bind the country and have your own sovereign currency and a bank that serves your will, the rules of borrowing are a little different. For a start money is unlimited, a government with its own currency can't run out of money any more than the NRL can run out of points to give out (the other important point in this analogy being that no they can't just give them out willy-nilly). <br /><br />When they say &quot;there is no debt crisis&quot; the part they're saying is fake is the last word. Debt is not at crisis, creditors are not demanding we pay now! Now! Now! And there is little likelihood that this will change because the above means they'll get their regular payments in perpetuity.<br /><br />Now deficits do matter, but in a more abstract way than the individual faces with mortgages &quot;pay up or lose your house&quot;. When the government borrows money that is money now unavailable for investment borrowing or lending to a budding homeowner etc. However this is fine in most cases, a new train line or whatever is likely of more value to society (not to government, government doesn't care about money, as above, so it's all about societal benefit) than next years iPhone. If the government borrows too much they'll push up interest rates which will slow the economy down, deficits can also drive up inflation by adding govt purchases over and above what consumers were buying anyway. This is the risk or deficit.<br /><br />That said interest rates going up and inflation tracking higher is not always bad. You don't want inflation below 0% as then you enter Japan style stagnation and interest rates similarly you don't want below 0% because if the economy goes into further downturn then interest rates don't have room to fall and adjust! causing further stagnation. So when inflation is low and interest rates are falling or very low it's a decent economic idea to run a deficit as it's nearly 100% benefit if you aren't pushing inflation or interest rates up, as this represents a weaker economy where some resources (as represented by these extra savings and lack or spending) are unemployed and should be put to use by the government rather than languishing until investors and consumers &quot;feel confident&quot; again. <br /><br />The time to pursue surplus and pay down debt is when the economy is roaring forward and is not wasting resources. Paying down debt and cutting govt spending/raising tax at such a time helps to tamp down inflation and interest rates keeping a surging economy from overheating and forming bubbles and crashing.<br /><br />Sorry about the dense post, I hope I explained this well. Just remember that a government is not a person with a mortgage, nor is it a business in any way (another common fallacy I see around), it lives by special rules and you need to think in th</p>

	<p>Garthside: &quot; If the government borrows too much they'll push up interest rates which will slow the economy down&quot;,  that defies what has happened in many countries around the world. The borrowing kept on going regardless and we are in the same position due to Labors spend-a-thon. <br /><br />Had they put the money into waterfront infrastructure (its a joke) or into roads or hospitals it might have served us well but they didn't. I read that there were over 20 large projects costed and ready to go, but they chose pink batts, hand outs, $refugees and an unaffordable NBN. Same as it ever was....<br /><br />There is cheap money all over the world and therefore interest rates will remain low for some time. <br /><br />I believe that Greece just over took us as  the 2nd fastest growing borrower in the world. If their borrowings were pushing up their interest rates and inflation your scenario would not have them as the second fastest growing borrower in the world.<br /><br />Would you have us like them?<br /><br />I read an article by a real economist stating that Australia was not a normal economy, so much of our wealth comes from mines and agriculture and we do not have a broad based economy and a small population to support this economy.<br /><br />I suspect that your well mannered post is straight out of a book and that you have little real world knowledge of this complex area.</p>

	<p>Australia's government net debt is less than 20% of GDP. We have more or less the lowest government debt of any developed country.<br /><br />No economist, or government anywhere views our government debt as a problem, or even approaching a problem.<br /><br />Hockey says governments should run their budget like a household budget. If he really believed that then he would be trying to rapidly increase the debt because the household debt in this country is more than 100% of GDP.<br /><br /><br />The deficit, and all the promised spending programs can easily be covered if the government had the strength of will to address the revenue side of the equation.<br /><br /><br />The obvious targets are :<br /> - tax avoidance by companies<br /> - the massive tax concessions on superannuation<br /> - negative gearing and capitalgains tax concessions on real estate<br /> - company car  tax concessions<br /> - subsidies to the mining and banking sectors<br /> - and of course ridiculous programs like the 250 million a year on school chaplains<br /></p>

	<p>mt syd. Well posted but I would add one more to that very fair and sensible list of revenue raising.<br /><br />Increase the Capital Gains Tax. The CGT currently favours the wealthy and the developers at the expense of the rest of us.<br /><br />Howard of course cut back the CGT and we have heard little since. Time to put this one on the table also.<br /><br />The  truly independent &quot;Grattan Institute&quot; recently strongly suggested that Negative Gearing, the Superannuation rorts and CGT should be dumped and scaled back and reformed. These suggestions should seriously be implemented by government. If so we would truly have a group of serious economic managers rather than a group of Ideological Misfits who are determined to care for vested interests come what may to the majority and greater society just so selected interests can prosper whilst the rest are destined  to become but &quot;Serfs&quot; of the imposed overlords who are currently wrecking the planet.<br /><br />I strongly suggest that Labor get off its backside as well and try doing something more constructive instead of continuously skipping around the edges as a nothing more than  the better of two evils.  However with Abbott in control Labor is just so much more preferable. At least Labor don't target the disadvantaged, the disabled, the students, the pensioners, the youth unemployed and sell off all and any public assets that are left in Australia and dismantle public services all for the Glorious Conservative (Pinochet emulating) agenda currently on offer from the Abbott junta.<br /><br /></p>

Thought so no idea....and could not care less....&quot;<br /><br />Well, if it was important, between 8 and 10 years.<br /><br />The structural tax cuts introduced by the Howard and Rudd governments reduce the governments tax receipts by about 5% of GDP, which is about $75 billion in 2013 dollars. Repeal those and clear the debt in 8 years.<br /><br />The current superannuation tax concessions cost the government around 3.5% of GDP in lost tax revenue. Abolish those and clear the debt in 11 years.<br /><br />Repeal both and clear the debt in 5 years.</p>

	<p>Ardy, the tax concessions on superannuation already cost as much as the entire aged pension. As a scheme to reduce the cost of looking after the elderly it is already a failure. The bulk of the tax benefits of superannuation goes to the top few percent, for low income earners it actually costs them money - they pay more tax by having super than they would if they were paying income tax only.<br /><br />In its current form super is an enormous drain on government revenues, favours the wealthy at the expense of everyone else, and fails as means to replace or support the pension</p>

	<p>Mark O.<br /><br />How about the one where a government gets elected on a culture of misinformation and fear and then promises all  sorts of wonderful agendas and cuts that will never happen and is on a unity ticket with all that is good for society and then renegs save the most important and justifiable promises that got them to government in the first place. It matters not that it is economically stupid.<br /><br />First the repeal of the Carbon Tax. Now with the Carbon Tax gone that equates to $5billion in revenue that the government now does not receive. point one. Secondly true to its word and regardless of the great leader declaring &quot;Climate Change is Crap&quot; that government now introduces the most capable and thought out policy on record &quot;Direct Action&quot;. Direct Action is when you pay the culprits to stop committing an offence (ie the big Polluters from polluting). All very well. Now that is going to cost the taxpayers $2.5 billion over 4 years for an outcome that is totally above board and reassured by a fantastic environment minister (no questions asked). Now add the first and second together the great government is now missing out on about $5.75 billions per annum in the minus.<br /><br />I am of course still waiting for the reduction in gigantic proportions of my energy costs but somehow by magic my energy costs are increasing. But hey if the government says I will benefit at a real economic imperative who am I or anyone else to argue.<br /><br />Then there was the repeal of the vastly unfair to mining corporations &quot;Mining Tax&quot;. Thank goodness that is gone and we the Australian taxpayer continue to subsidise the fuel rebate for mining corporations. Also how many $billions in revenue would of the Mining Tax started to bring into government. <br /><br />Well all I can say is that at last with this government we have responsible economic managers who blame the unjust senate for not passing unjust, unfair and nasty budget measures. Sack the senate. Get some dirt on them. Coerce them with text messages and make idiots out of them in the media to add pressure if possible. <br /><br />BTW like you Mark O I would of loved Gunns to desolate the forests. ASAP. Tree huggers wouldn't have a clue.</p>

	<p>Did you mean &quot;sustained&quot; or &quot;unsustained&quot; growth is over?<br /><br />At east peak oil has been avoided, the US oil companies recently declared it dead, since they have so much energy available from CSG, it means oil will last centuries longer<br /><br />yay for technology<br /><br />Population control, sure, but only be disease or war - there is no way any country is going to willing cull their population.<br /><br />So now what?<br /><br />it's one thing to say, oh this is what we should do .. but let's face it, you have n solution to the &quot;how will it be done&quot;<br /><br />do you?  the Greens do, they will deprive everyone of energy, and that will kill .. but only here where the Greens are actually listened to.</p>

	<p>Peak oil was ten years ago, thereabouts. Since then, the fracking sensation has been nothing more than a QE sponsored ponzi scheme. The global economy can not support +$100 crude oil and the oil producers can not maintain production &quot;growth&quot; without it.<br />A lot of wished into existence money has been invested in shale oil and that money looks likely to have been wasted and may even be the spark that ignites GFC MkII.<br /></p>

	<p>Peak CONVENTIONAL oil happened in 2005. The increase in production since has been from expensive unconventional oil, which is why the global economy will not recover. The current drop in oil prices is due to lack of demand, or in other words the oil is too expensive for economies to purchase adequate amounts for growth.<br /><br />Population growth will stop as humanity is hitting the limits of resource consumption, which is one of the limiting factors of all animal populations. Humans are just like all other animals and multiply in times of abundant resources and collapse once depletion of resources occurs.<br /><br />The economic growth experiment is almost over, and the conclusion will be collapse...<br /><br /></p>

	<p>&quot;The increase in production since has been from expensive unconventional oil,&quot;<br /><br />Nope, Saudi Arabia has been steadying increasing production, up 20% in the last three years, and has refused to cut back as US oil import demand collapses. This has meant the price of oil has halved in six months, which the Saudis hope will drive the shale oil producers out of business, with the bonus of punishing Russia and Iran (their rivals in Syria). <br /><br />&quot;Population growth will stop as humanity is hitting the limits of resource consumption&quot;<br /><br />Unlikely, human population growth has already almost stopped, due to prosperity. Collapse is not yet guaranteed, the post growth experiment will be interesting but the future could include a stable, prosperous, smaller and sustainable human population.</p>

	<p>Saudi Arabia increase in last 3 years to August is closer to 10%.<br />It is other oil producing countries that are in decline. Without fracking, global production is in decline.<br />Tight oil wells have fast depletion rates and require ever more rigs in order to increase production. Rig count and new licences are down due to current low prices. A shake up in the tight oil industry will put an end to the temporary glut which, is mainly due to demand destruction rather than production increases.</p>

	<p>Oh! to be a Green and have the luxury of coming up with the most ideologically correct policies, knowing that I would never have to implement them or take responsibility for them.<br /><br />Ms Milne's gratuitous attack on Bill Shorten was a reminder that Labor is the Green's natural rivals - they need to take votes from Labor as they will never persuade Libs to vote for them.This explains why the Greens voted with the Libs to knock out the ETS and to stop the Malaysian Solution for refugees.<br />Unlike Milne who doesn't have to worry about Budget bottom lines, it is unrealistic to expect Shorten to come up with solutions until he knows the level of debt this incompetent government will leave behind them when they are thrown out.</p>

	<p>The budget bottom line is that we have pretty close to the smallest debt of any developed country, a net debt of less than 20% of GDP.<br /><br />The way to fix the structural imbalance in the budget is to address both sides of the equation, revenue as well as expenditure.<br /><br />It appears the current government does not have the cojones to make the hard choices and look at the revenue side.<br /><br />The fact is that all our budget woes could be fixed relatively easily without damaging the economy if the government were willing to reduce tax concessions on super for the top end of town, remove negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions on real estate, and crack down on corporate tax avoidance</p>

	<p>Once again I find myself disappointed by the rhetoric of Senator Milne.   It seems as though she is approaching the MYFEO with a closed mind.  Ultimately such a mindset is self defeating and it just excludes the Greens from the process and makes their existence in the Senate meaningless.<br /><br />Senator Milne talks of costed proposals but fails to mention specifics.   In an excellent opportunity to talk in details she gives us little but meaningless waffle designed to do nothing more than tap into the moronic mindset that the &quot;big end of town is bad.  Greens is good.&quot;<br /><br />At the end of the day the Greens will continue to be irrelevant until such time as they get a little pragmatism going and at least get themselves into the room in which the negotiations are taking place.   In many respects I blame the Greens for the situation where we are being held hostage by marginal groups like PUP and the other loony fringes of the Senate crossbench.<br /></p>

	<p>Edward,<br /><br />If, by 'a little pragmatism' you mean kowtowing to large global corporations, with only short-term advantages going to the wealthy elite, and deliberately smothered technological science-based research, there would seem little point in joining, if you're interested in developing a new economy that moves with the times and with changing environmental and financial situations.<br /><br />If you're looking for detail, you'd get a great deal more from checking with the Greens' website, than you would from either Labor or Coalition equivalents, even if you could believe anything they say.<br /><br />Certainly some pragmatism is required, but if pragmatism goes beyond what is sensible, constructive and effective for the nation as a whole, then it ought to be rejected in favour of common sense responses to changed circumstances. Despite Abbott's mindset, it's not the 1950s.</p>

	<p>DrDavid,<br /><br />I suppose my idea of pragmatism is not rejecting proposals outright because they don't meet all of some &quot;idealized&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot; world view.   <br /><br />To give a simple example, when the indexation issue of the fuel excise came up Senator Milne flip flopped a little bit then decided that the Greens wouldn't countenance it at all.  If I had been her I would have kept my cards close to my chest and simply followed the line that I would like to talk to the Government in detail about the proposal.   Once in the room she could have pushed an agenda behind closed doors.  If that failed then I have no problems with her dumping on the Government.  But to exclude oneself  from even the chance of getting some of what the Greens want is silly.  With this issue it became more of a media stunt than anything else.<br /><br />Neither the ALP or the LNP like the Greens.   As a party it is likely that the Greens will never hold government.   This means that they have to try and make some headway in areas they favour accepting some &quot;bad&quot; things for some &quot;good&quot; things.  The current approach simply means deals are done with PUP and others with little or no benefit in the areas of Green advocacy.<br /><br />the cynic in me looks at the way they carry on and conclude that they are more interested in maintaining their base support so they get re-elected to the gravy train rather than risking it all and actually making a difference.</p>

	<p>&quot;The solutions, as Milne correctly points out, are not rocket science, and the problem is not particularly dire&quot;<br /><br />Then why didn't she outline specific policies?   It's not like she's going to end up in Government and has to act like an opposition who hides away policies for fear of getting them stolen by the Government.   The Greens should be quite happy to have their policies &quot;stolen&quot;.<br /><br />But all we get is the old big end of town rant.   If she gives us specifics we can look at them in a cold, clear rational manner and then dump on them.   And that's why they don't give us anything beyond rhetoric.</p>

	<p>If it were a member of the &quot;public&quot; then I'd agree with what you say.  But Senator Milne is a representative putting forward a view in a public forum seeking to sway opinion.   I don't think it's unreasonable to expect something more from her than a simple rant about the big end of town.  <br /><br />This is one of the problems with political debate nowadays.  Too much rhetoric and not enough detail.   What's so hard about her saying I don't like this and this is my solution to it and I would value feedback.   This sort of thing has been done on this site before.   I recall a Labor polly posting an item to get an idea of what the public was thinking about education and its future direction.</p>

	<p>&quot;The Greens' fully costed policies to this end would raise almost $70 billion.&quot;<br /><br />I went to The Greens' website and looked at the policies.<br />I didn't find any mention of tax increases, though there were plenty of policies that would cost tens of billions.<br />Now I did only look at the synopses for each of the &quot;policy-platform&quot; entries at their website, but frankly if there really were $70B in revenue raising, you'd think it would be mentioned.<br />Anyone care to point me to these &quot;fully costed&quot; policies, it would be entertaining reading.<br /></p>

	<p>When you take away income from the earner and hand it to govt, there is a net change in where that money is directed. The individual that loses the income is disadvantaged. I have no faith that the Greens have a clue how an economy works.

	<p>&quot;They think you can tax something at any rate and nothing will change&quot;<br /><br />No, you are completely wrong there mate. It is quite clear from the greens policies themselves that they have a good understanding about the way taxes operate as incentives or disincentives. You just cant be bothered to read anything that might conflict with your pre conceived ideas - shock horror, the Greens have better economic policies than Hockey!<br /><br />Take for example the issue of negative gearing, and capital gains tax concessions on real estate. The greens say no - because it costs a lot in government revenue, and because it distorts investment choices away from productive investment.<br /><br />The greens and the economists are in agreement. But not Hockey.<br /><br />Take the Mineral Resource Rent tax - formulated by an economist (Dr Ken Henry) in the treasury, and similar to the taxes used in some of the wealthiest countries in the world eg Norway.<br /><br />Hockey says no, it will kill mining - cancels the tax, mining not doing so good anyway, and Australia misses out on the benefits of the mining boom. Stupidity on a grand scale, unless you happen to be mates with the miners.<br /><br />Climate change - greens say we ought to be doing something because the science says it is a problem. Hockey says a free market option is the wrong approach - lets just give money to polluters instead. Who is it that understand incentives?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>The mineral tax would not be working because of the significant decline in price and therefore profits(one of the primary causes of the write down as per both hockey and swan). Swan and Gillard's biggest mistakes was to tie spending to a tax that relied so much on commodity prices, when they go down and raise nothing the costs attached have to meet else where, and when there is no other revenue the costs than go to the deficit. Pretty simple economics, so don't tie spending to a tax, particularly a tax that has a floating cost base like the mining tax did.</p>

	<p>&quot;Earth to la la land. The mining boom finished a while ago.&quot;<br /><br /><br />yes, and the Howard government spent the windfall on tax cuts, how dumb is that? - to fund a permanent structural change with a temporary surge in revenue. And when the ALP tried to impose the Mining tax (which only raises money when profits are at above normal levels - ie in booms), guess who opposes it? Our magic pudding buddies, Hockey and Abbott. <br /><br />If the Howard government had not be so profligate, and if the mining tax had not been opposed and watered down, our budget balance would be in the black now.<br /><br />&quot;You haven't told us why mum&amp;dad investors won't be able to deduct investment losses against their income....&quot;<br /><br />Sorry if I havent laid out a complete a detailed set of policies for you. I guess you will have to wait until I am PM.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Why do the Greens hate Mums and Dads and so favour the rich?&quot;<br /><br />good one<br /><br />&quot;there is nothing free market about imposing a tax.&quot;<br /><br />on the contrary, a price on carbon corrects a market failure. A market can only function efficiently if all the costs of production are included in the sale price. These types of missing costs are called externalities (probably not something Ray Hadley talks about)<br /></p>

	<p>Tax concessions are already reduced for incomes in excess of $300k. Do you have any actual figures supplied by their &quot;fully-costed&quot; policy?<br /><br />How does the removal of &quot;negative gearing&quot; operate?<br />Does this mean that a family buying an investment property can no longer deduct investment income losses against their wages, but a wealthy person with multiple properties can deduct losses from one investment against other property investments?<br /><br />I assume that you mean &quot;removal of capital gains exemption on the family home&quot;, bet that policy will be really popular.<br />Let's just do their ads for them: &quot;We're The Greens and we want to put a capitals gains tax on your home&quot;. Why are they so shy about this policy?<br /><br />Ah the school chaplaincy program. The one that was established by the Gillard government in 2012 as an expansion of an already existing support program for schools, and which is receiving less money under Abbott. Nice!<br /><br />Could you point out where on their site I can read about the &quot;fully-costed&quot; details?</p>

	<p>Im not the Greens Harry, if you want the details I suggest you write to them and ask them. They appear to be, by far, the most open and transparent of any party regarding policies, funding, and everything else.<br /><br />There are a couple of ways to deal with real estate negative gearing, the simplest being to simply not allow any negative gearing on investment property. Similarly with the capital gains tax concessions that apply to investment properties.<br /><br />The chaplaincy program was actually started by the Howard government. Not that it really matters. It costs 250 million every year, and is a complete waste.<br /><br />Superannuation tax concessions cost the government as much as the entire aged pension. So it is a clear budgetary failure if it is intended to reduce the cost of supporting the elderly. And the bulk of the benefit of these concessions goes to the wealthiest. So there is another few billions of low hanging fruit if you are looking at savings and cutting entitlements.<br /><br />Mining companies receive billions in subsidies every year. So much for the end of the age of entitlement!!!</p>

	<p>So your &quot;most open and transparent&quot; party somehow doesn't  give you any detail you can point to. Bizarre. It's not like I asked a hard question.<br /><br />&quot;The simplest being to simply not allow any negative gearing on investment property&quot;<br />But investment companies will effectively be able to deduct all their interest losses, against other investment incomes because they can apportion all borrowings against all investments, whereas the mum &amp; dad investor only has one investment. So the Greens is an pro-rich policy and attacks the middle class. Nice!<br /><br />&quot;The chaplaincy program was actually started by the Howard government.&quot;<br />Actually the current program was modified by Gillard, it allows for secular chaplains. The Howard one didn't<br /><br />&quot;It costs 250 million every year, and is a complete waste.&quot;<br /><br />Here is the quote from the budget:<br />&quot;The Government will provide an additional $245.3 million over five years (including $1.5 million in 2018&amp;#8209;19) to continue the National School Chaplaincy Programme until December 2018.&quot;<br />As usual you are wrong. The peak funding is $61.5M in 2015-16.<br /><br />Could you outline the billions of &quot;subsidies&quot; you claim the mining companies receive. You seem certain of yourself so you should be able to tell us the *facts* behind this statement.<br /><br />As usual your analysis of super versus the age pension is based on a facile presumption, that the numbers receiving the full and partial pensions are a constant percentage of the population.<br />In reality the numbers are falling rapidly because of super.<br />In 2009 nearly 60% of pension aged people were on a full pension, in 2013 there are less than 50%. In a *perfect* world the cost of pensions would be zero because everyone would retire on their own super. Hence a comparison of the *cost* of super versus the aged pension is misleading and silly.<br /></p>

	<p>&quot;The peak funding is $61.5M in 2015-16.&quot;<br /><br />I stand corrected. The cost of the chapliancy program isas you say 61.5 million a year.<br /><br />And is still a complete waste<br /><br />The billions are subsidies that miners receive has been well documented elsewhere<br /><br />&quot;As usual your analysis of super versus the age pension is based on a facile presumption, that the numbers receiving the full and partial pensions are a constant percentage of the population.&quot;<br /><br />No, i make no such assumption.

	<p>Harry,<br /><br />Having no life I did go and look at the Greens website.   As you imply thre are a lot of motherhood satements about what they'll do - it's rather funny as it comes across as they are going to form a government.   (what's that phrase? &quot;tell them they're dreaming.)<br /><br />The revenue raising measures are under the heading &quot;Resourcing a caring society&quot;.  They are rather interesting.   I get the impression they don't like miners or the banks and when implemented I don't think we'll have any banks or miners left.  That could be a bit of a problem as when they go there will be no tax raised so no spending possible.<br /><br />In all seriousness I think there is a problem with the figures to the extent that the policies fall into the same trap that the ALP fell into the revenue raising measures are variable while the spending seems to be fairly stable.  A recipe for disaster.  I suspect the figures for the mining tax revamp are already out of date given the way that the iron ore price has fallen out of bed recently. But if someone from the Greens thinks differently I would be more than happy to stand corrected.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>Thanks Christine for the article it is refreshing to finally get a Green perspective.<br /><br />If political parties, unions the media and religion all exist to represent intellect or the meek over the the natural rulers, the more powerful and wealthy, wouldn't it be a good idea for them to all be on modest incomes?<br /><br />If everyone who works for or represents the public interest has excellent working conditions and  a healthy work /life balance , wouldn't this help resist personal greed and increase the likelihood of a flow on effect for all?<br /><br />It seems that our institutions have been overun by people who aspire to wealth and power in return for service and it is dimming their ability to hold the perspective of the common person.<br /><br />&quot;They&quot; seem to think we could all be rich in a material sense and that this is the most important thing in life, it is not sustainable and impossible to implement , I wonder what the Greens think of this?</p>

	<p>Well 'Wry Pocket', I assume that Labor still have fingers, even if they seem to be lacking in the mouth department, so they can get on their little keyboards and come in here and defend themselves if they can muster the energy.<br /><br />Two words you wrote just about sum it up - 'they lack'.  Labor isn't doing anything much except 'lying doggo' while Abbott's crew blow themselves up.  I suppose it's a fair strategy but it isn't very ballsy.  I so admire Christine Milne, she has more balls than any of the so called 'blokes' in our parliament.<br /><br />Bless you Christine Milne!  What a wonderful transformation this country would have if people ever gave you a turn at the helm.  The way things are going, maybe it could be possible after all.  We don't have much to lose anyway, and we could have so much to gain.  :)</p>

	<p>Balancing anything is pretty easy, you raise funds and then you can pay. The forward spending in linked to what is availiable by way of revenue...simple. We have had governments of both flavour race to reduce income, by reducing tax, and at the same time, promising more services. It doesn't work that way. The Medicare levy is now insufficient to fund the health care system. Surely the answer is to raise the tax rate, raise the Medicare Levy and at the same time, get the bludgers at the big end of town to actually pay their way.<br />This Government made a rod for their own back, when they failed to give the ALP leeway for the GFC, that by the way we rode out very well, falling commodity prices and measures they were unable to get through a holtile senate. They can not cry foul now. Joe's own words were that Swan was the master of excuses and that if he were a Company Director he would be in Jail.......That rod must feel very uncomfortable, Joe. It's rigt up there with the cigar that will haunt you up to the next election.</p>

	<p>Put simply the current government have not struck a balance that many can accept. Most fair minded people see it that way. The only current conservative government who have got away with this approach is in NSW and to be fair they have come in behind such a rotten previous govt. and even they have been hammered in by-elections.  At federal level they have compounded the problem by firstly not letting on what their real agenda was prior to being elected and secondly presented an arrogant and disrespectful face to the public - they have added real meaning to the throw away line &quot;born to rule&quot;. They should not have embarked on any of their own spending agenda until they had sorted out the mess they have added to - hardly sound budget management. More importantly their whole approach has been one of negativity BUT spend, spend, spend at Christmas? They have been in such a rush to have &quot;their place in the sun&quot; no matter what they have seriously misread the mood of the public. There will need to be a major turn around before the next election otherwise they are going to have their own crap thrown back at them and quite frankly rightly so. I suspect the mid MYEFO will be more scaremongering and cost cutting instead of some sensible policy where balanced give and take is at the forefront.</p>

	<p>A.G.O.G.,<br /><br />I too am completely baffled by our head-banging behaviour. We slavishly follow the American model in all things, including economics, greed, violence, and more recently, extremism in various forms.<br /><br />We know the American way doesn't work - a quick look at current American society will confirm it.<br /><br />Meanwhile, those 'lucky' Scandinavians keep getting it right, resulting in a fair, generally happy society, and, not by accident, very strong, stable economies that are capable of supporting high standards of lifestyle, education and productivity.<br /><br />I'm hoping the current insane burst of belated neoliberalism is the last-gasp of American ideology. If we can get rid of Lib/Lab corporate obedience, maybe we can copy the Scandinavians, if actual original thinking is beyond us.</p>

	<p>Some highlights of the all grown up Scandanavians and immigrants.<br />&quot;Over 100 Nigerians were deported from four Scandinavian countries for immigration and related offences&quot; Dec 2014<br />&quot;A record number of immigrants were deported from Norway in October, according government figures. A total of 824 people were deported by the National Police Immigration Service Norway (Politiets Utlendingsenhet) last month, surpassing the previous record of the 763 people deported in September. &quot; Nov 2014<br />&quot;Legal notification to leave Norway has been served to nearly 15,000 illegal immigrants by the National Police Immigration Service Norway&quot; Sep 2014<br />&quot;During the first half of this year, 3,167 people were forced out of Norway&quot; July 2014<br />&quot;Almost every fifth Norwegian municipality that has been asked to accept new refugees said no in 2013&quot;<br /><br />Finland accepts 34 asylum seekers per 100000 population.<br />At that rate Australia would accept 7,400 asylum seekers a year. I'm guessing we could look &quot;grown up&quot; too if we only had to cope with those levels.<br /><br />Norway has no mining taxes, they have a petroleum and gas resource tax, so do we.<br /></p>

	<p>So?- we deport people too- we also  keep kids in detention. Does Norway? Sweden is taking in 30,000 asylum seekers this year- most from the tragedy of Syria which the West with its 'regime changes&quot; helped create. <br /><br />Norway does not need a mining tax- it OWNS or partly owns its resources.<br />As I said they are more grown up- your response is childish.</p>

	<p>All Christine seems to be missing is the sacrificial chicken. I cannot believe that anyone believes the voodoo economic rubbish pedaled by the Greens. They have shown that they have such a hatred of Tony Abbot that they will vote against their own policies if the Liberals put them before the parliament and by endless repetition of their nonsense seemed to have convinced the low information voter that all their promises can be met by borrowing and forcing Gina Rhinehart to pay more tax. The claims that she and her party continually make that we can maintain our standard of living whilst shutting down industry and replacing the jobs it provides with an army of public servants invite us all to bare our backsides to the sun whilst sticking our heads in the sand.  Her claims that no one believes that the previous government in which she participated left us with a trajectory of spending commitments that can not be met by the expectations of the levels of tax all governments have left us with are pure bumpkin. Their oft repeated refrain that this can be solved by taxing &quot;someone else&quot; more is just plain dishonesty.</p>

	<p>Thanks for the article Christine.<br />I think people will accept a fair and sensible response to the current economic/budgetary situation. Abbott's government hasn't come up with anything like that so far.<br />That said, I also recall Leigh Sale's recent interview with B.S.<br />(How apt are those initials!)<br />Apart from his vague threats against the evil multinationals and a bit of moralistic posturing about those who are &quot;not paying interest on their $2,000,000 super&quot;- he didn't inspire much confidence in this little black duck. <br />If hitting the multis is the way to go then why didn't his pals do it last time they were in? Ditto on the wealthy superannuants.<br />Neither of the two major parties are very inspiring and given the relatively balanced numbers of &quot;rusted on&quot; supporters, neither can afford to annoy too many swinging voters.<br /><br />I think we are probably heading for more government debt and ongoing deficits no matter who wins the next election, especially given the falling prices for our mineral resources.<br />I also think we need four year fixed terms everywhere and urgent tweaking of the way the &quot;unrepresentative swill&quot; are elected.<br />Have a good one.</p>

	<p>As with John Hewson you have party  spelt out the problems fairly well Christine but apart from a vague  reference  to Green policies you have not given explicit details of your solutions unlike Hewson who did. <br />And like Hewson who omitted to mention household debt you have omitted to mention just what is happening out there in the real world.<br /><br />In your deserved condemnation of banks and corporations you should have mentioned the open letter to all Australians by Dr. David Pascoe PHD OVH published in the AIM network. If you have not read it I suggest you should-all Australians should.<br /><br />The letter is titled 'Bastard Banks and politicians 'and refers to Charlie Philott who was one of many farmers forced off their farms by banks. <br />The letter discloses a meeting held at Winton-attending by Ministers - it is a heart wrenching story.  That meeting called for the establishment of an Australian Development  Bank something the Greens should take up.<br /><br />Dr Pascoe is very critical of banks  and politicians. He has some very harsh  words to sat about current State and Federal  Government.<br /><br />Christine Milne should be doing something both the LNP and ALP refuse to do-warn Australians of the predatory practices  of financial capitalism- farmers today- small business  tomorrow-the rest of us the next day.<br /><br />But to be taken seriously she needs to articulate reasonable and doable policies- including and most importantly policies affecting asylum seekers. The fact is there that are less deaths at sea= there are no human rights on the bottom of the ocean.<br />If only the Greens could modify some of their 'fringe' policies they could give us the sort of politics of Elizabeth Warren in the U.S. She is taking on the cabal of politicians and big business - which is what we need to do here.</p>

	<p>I remember when some employees of Westpac were jailed for selling loans to Australian farmers in overseas currency when interest rates were low without telling them that if rates went up (remember Keating's 17%) they may not be able to make the repayments.<br /><br />Many farming families lost everything because of this greed but only a few middle ranked bank Johnnies were charged. The big boys got away with it.<br /><br />The only thing that has changed are the laws protecting the banks. <br /><br />You don't see to many bankers going to jail for shonky behaviour these days do you.</p>

	<p>There can be little argument with the proposition that the drop off in the terms of trade especially in the prices received by Australia for its minerals has been a major determinant in the increase in the size of the budget deficit.<br /><br />That point conceded Australians can reasonably ask why that contingency when encountered by an LNP administration is a mitigating circumstance whereas the previous Treasurer was pilloried by the very same two people who now say it is an element which by any fair consideration can be said to be beyond their control. <br /><br />Interestingly by emphasising the importance of the drop in revenue Mr Hockey and Mr Cormann have completely vindicated those commentators who have previously identified that Budget issues cannot be dealt with by a &quot;slash and burn&quot; campaign alone. <br /><br />Indeed axing 175 agencies which in many cases are probably carrying out important functions to save $1/2 Billion over four years is mindblowing. What will be the cost of making these people unproductive both from the cost of redundancy, the revenue forgone from income tax and if the worst comes to the worst in a shrinking jobs market the cost of unemployment benefits.<br /><br />Consumer and business confidence in the domestic economy becomes even more important in a time of dwindling export revenues. Unfortunately far from encouraging Australians that they can influence their own futures the LNP have run around the world for the last 6 years sceaming at anybody who will listen to the line that the place is a basket case. Mandrake the Surplus Magician and his apprentice are now imploring us to spend up big at Christmas to &quot;get us out of the hole&quot;.<br /><br />Hard to do this when many people fear that after the festive season they will not have a job to help pay for the Christmas spending spree.</p>

	<p>No they are not capable of learning anything. We have seen their vision and we reject it, with extreme prejudice!! I reckon for a revenue stream we could get Smoking Joe to increase his fees for his private meetings with business. $22,000 is selling him short. Ask not what your country can do for you Joe but what you can do for your country. If you do not resign (preferred option) sling some of your &quot;fees&quot; to the community.</p>

	<p>The frustrating part of this article is that if our political parties are funded by corporate donations and lobby groups how on earth do the Greens think they are going to change anything without addressing this first.<br />Why can't this awful part of our politics be addressed by the Greens?<br /> Surely ongoing talks with the Labour party is the only way the corporate juggernaut could be derailed and investment returned into Australian projects and infrastructure such as improved rail services for a start. <br />Multinationals are not going to invest in local research and development.<br />Even the real coalition will breathe a sigh of relief when this grip is loosened. Come on Christine broach the subject.</p>

	<p>Christine Milne has done a good job with this articale. It's calm and reasoned.<br /><br />Where it falls down is basically the same problem as Tony. There is no detailed explanation. Just statements.<br /><br />The reason I think it OK is that I understand, from other reading, that she is on the right track. She did herself no favours in skimming over the detail.<br /><br />No, I don't vote green, but I don't campaign for or against anyone 'cept the party without a soul.</p>

	<p>Poor Christine is at it again.<br /><br />Just for the record<br /><br />If the Australian electorate wanted higher taxes, more Green morality lessons, and endless Government intervention, they would have voted for you.<br /><br />What is the green proportion of primary votes?  Enough said.<br /><br />And Christine, if you don't like coal, by all means head to the major customers ( China et al ) and shout invective at them. They are, after all, driving the trade. Try chaining yourself to some machinery there and see how much of your arm remains intact.<br /><br />And please stop the born to hector role. The Greens have made an art form of lying since day one. I well recall Bobby telling us solemnly on the ABC one night that losing timber wouldn't matter because &quot;It will create 620,000 jobs in Tasmania in tourism. Really???<br /><br />People who live in glass houses.......</p>

	<p>The true issue for the downturn is the lack of investment in the North of Australia, and regional Australia. Billions spent on inner city by-passes and rail networks, whilst the areas which are generating wealth deal with dangerous roads and poor infrastructure. We need sovereign funds to drought proof the Northern areas of Australia. We also need a primary bank to fund Australian individuals and families into farms. A succession of older farmers to a new generation is required. It is not good enough for foreigners and the Chinese to buy up our most productive agricultural farms and enterprises. Australia lacks the political will to prioritise infrastructure in regional areas, and this is where the long term growth in our economy lies. We will continue to underperform until the North is either independent or autonomous. The big failure of our Sydney, Melbourne bias, is that the rest of Australia does not get a fair shake. The divergent paths between the Northern Region, and the South require an alternate political enterprise.</p>
