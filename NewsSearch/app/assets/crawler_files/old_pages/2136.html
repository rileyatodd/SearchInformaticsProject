                <meta name="description" content="As Joe Hockey prepares to release the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) it is imperative to face some basic realities. Both sides of politics have made huge, mostly unfunded, expenditure commitments and also foreshadowed lower personal and business taxes. This simply doesn&#039;t add up. Instead of concentrating on undeliverable, short-term political promises about the budget, we should create an overarching strategy that incorporates the restructuring of our Federation and tax system."/>

       When Joe Hockey releases the MYEFO we should take the opportunity to face some basic realities.  <span class="source">(AAP: Dave Hunt)</span>
      </a></div>
</div>
  <p><strong><em>As Joe Hockey prepares to release the MYEFO, we should move away from short-term political promises and look to how the restructuring of Federation and our tax system can really "fix the budget", writes John Hewson.</em></strong></p><p>As Joe Hockey promises to release the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) this week it is imperative to face some basic realities.</p><p>The discussion needs to be elevated above the facile and futile games played by both sides of politics in recent years that concentrated on undeliverable, short-term, political promises about when the budget would be returned to surplus.</p><p>This is especially so given the weakness of our economy, as it struggles to make a transition from a resources boom to whatever, against a very difficult global environment that promises a particularly volatile 2015, as both challenging economic and geo-political forces play out.</p><p>The origins of the current and prospective budget challenges go back to the Howard years, and were compounded by both expenditure and tax commitments made by both sides of politics in the run-up to the last election. These have been compounded further by poor economic forecasting, and the hostilities in the Senate.</p><p>Howard/Costello enjoyed several years of unexpectedly strong revenue growth that (as Treasury data has confirmed), essentially, they spent. For example, the bulk of the recent deficits would disappear if Howard/Costello (confirmed by Rudd) hadn't given the tax cuts.</p><p>Both sides of politics made huge, mostly unfunded, expenditure commitments in the run-up to the last election, which will compound over the next 10 years, in areas such as school reform, disability care and infrastructure, while also promising to avoid serious cuts in health, education and pensions.</p><p>They also foreshadowed lower personal and business taxes, all while also promising to "fix the budget - deficits and debt".</p><p>Clearly, this simply doesn't add up!</p><p>Treasury has also struggled to forecast our economy, with revenue estimates, in particular, under shooting in the Howard years, and then over shooting in more recent years.</p><p>All this is now compounded by the fact that Joe Hockey and the Abbott Government burnt a considerable amount of political capital with its first budget that, despite pre-budget assurances to the contrary, was particularly inequitable, and poorly explained.</p><p>The explanations failed at two levels. First, individual decisions, such as the Medicare co-payment and uni fees, were announced without an overarching health or education policy, against which the electorate could hope to understand and assess them.</p><p>Second, and importantly, the Government failed to provide an overarching narrative that could explain their budget strategy, and how it fitted into their overall policy framework.</p><p>In large measure, they don't have such a framework. They got away at the last election with mere "dot points" that they called policies - stop the boats, fix the budget, create two million jobs etc - enmeshed in a host of ad hoc "promises" or "commitments", mostly delivered to various audiences, interest groups, or in response to media questions, as they were confronted during the campaign.</p><p>It should not be surprising that it doesn't add up or hang together.</p><p>So, where to from here? I would suggest that they need to start with the overarching strategy. Say, commit to a 10-year target to double national productivity, and then seek to pull together the economic, industry and social policy reforms that will be required to get there. The restructuring of our Federation and tax, the reforms to education and training, industrial relations, industry policy, our financial system and infrastructure, along with strategies to develop technology, innovation and science, all against the challenge and opportunities of an adequate response to climate change, and so on.</p><p>In this context, the structure of the budget remains very important. In the near term, our economy can't withstand further negative growth from the public sector. In the medium term, a realistic restructuring of our Federation should see substantial expenditure savings by eliminating duplication between the Commonwealth and the states.</p><p>This will call for a decisive shift in the allocation of responsibilities, and a willingness to scale down, if not close, departments at one level of government.</p><p>For example, as with Canada, perhaps we could pass responsibility for all education to the states, thereby effectively closing the federal department except, perhaps, for setting and monitoring national standards. We could also do away with a federal minister for education.</p><p>Similarly, there are some functions that are truly national, such as the environment and industrial relations, and a host of transport and other regulations.</p><p>The basic point is that, ultimately, any reform will need to be a deal between the Commonwealth and the states, with both sides willing to compromise in the national interest.</p><p>Once the expenditure side is agreed, the emphasis will turn to the most effective way to fund the agreed division of responsibilities and service delivery. Hence, on the nature and detail of essential tax reform.</p><p>The basic reality here is that, with the existing revenue base likely to remain subdued for many years to come, and given the commitments made by both sides in relation to new spending programs, and certain taxes, spanning over the next 10 years or so, the overall burden of taxation will need to be increased in the medium term.</p><p>This should see a very detailed stocktake and assessment of taxation at all levels of government, again calling for some quite decisive shifts in taxing powers and in the structure of our overall tax system.</p><p>While some state taxes, such as stamp and insurance duties, should be scrapped as part of any reform, other state taxes, such as land and payroll, where the states have worked, by competing, to reduce their effectiveness, could be quite effective if set and administered nationally.</p><p>However, given political commitments by both sides to further lower business and personal tax, most attention will need to be on the main tax expenditures - in housing, superannuation and the GST - where the big tax concessions lie, and where the inequities are most pronounced.</p><p>Consider superannuation tax concessions as an example.

      </a></div><p> </p><p>Those at the bottom of the income scales actually have to pay to get a superannuation benefit, while those at the top enjoy almost obscene benefits. For example, somebody earning $20,000 has to pay about $118 to get a $100 benefit, while somebody earning $250,000 pays only about $62.50.</p><p>The GST is presently only applied to about 60 per cent of expenditure and at 10 per cent raises about $55 billion. To apply it across the board to all expenditure would probably raise about $80-90 billion (allowing for behavioural responses), and about twice that if (say) doubled. I am not advocating such a shift, simply wishing to provide some orders of magnitude.</p><p>Clearly, all options should be identified and debated publicly. The GST offers the capacity to compensate those most disadvantaged from any changes, as well as fund some of the desired/committed spending programs, abolish some ineffective/distortionary taxes, lower others, and address distribution issues between the states.</p><p>Finally, it would be desirable to consider splitting infrastructure spending and financing from the annual budget, both state and federal. The Commonwealth could beef up Infrastructure Australia, making it responsible for analysing and ranking all significant national infrastructure projects much more transparently than it does at present, against well established, accepted and published financial assessment principles.</p><p>The financing could be by way of a new, government-guaranteed, 30-50 year infrastructure bond at an attractive coupon rate. These funds would need to be collected and managed outside government, probably by way of a Future Fund type structure, with an independent board and management, on a fully transparent and accountable basis.</p><p>This fund could then work to provide debt and/or equity funding to projects of national significance, co-financing in both equity and debt terms with the private sector and banks, wherever possible.</p><p>These bonds would be most attractive, given our national AAA rated safe haven status, to sovereign wealth funds, central banks and governments, pension and superannuation funds, both globally and domestically.</p><p>Of course, our political leaders would have rise above their simplistic political notions that "all debt is bad", but it would allow them to make their infrastructure preferences publicly known, to be addressed by Infrastructure Australia and the proposed fund.</p><p>It seems to me that with so much of our social, transport and economic infrastructure deficient or in decline, this sort of approach is the most effective and constructive way to meet our infrastructure needs, and to give somebody a real hope of being "The Infrastructure Prime Minister".</p><p>Overall, given the likely magnitude and significance of the required changes to the structure of our Federation and taxation it may be preferable to have the Government break the total reform package into "bite sized chunks" by way of a series of propositions to be placed before the electorate, at successive elections over, say, the next 10 years.</p><p><em>John Hewson is Professor in the Crawford School ANU and former leader of the Liberal Party and the federal opposition.

	<p>Thanks John, good analysis.<br />re superannuation concessions: &quot;somebody earning $20,000 has to pay about $118 to get a $100 benefit, while somebody earning $250,000 pays only about $62.50.&quot;<br /><br />Says it all really.<br />The Age of Entitlement is upon us.<br />And the best either Liberals or Labor can do is look the other way.<br />Labor initiated the Henry Taxreview, then ditched 135 of 138 recommendations. Labor is a redundant force.<br />Liberals harp on about ending of the Age of Entitlement - right, will believe when I see.</p>

	<p>There is a false narrative being peddled by the Bunga Bunga Party and the compliant media, which says that both parties are at fault for the current economic situation. Hewson continues this falsehood, though rightly critical of the Abbott government. The truth is different.<br /><br />Never once did the Howard government deliver a cut in real spending in any of its 12 budgets. Nor did the Fraser government, for that matter, ever deliver a cut in real spending in its seven budgets. Twenty Coalition budgets and never a fall in real government outlays.<br /><br />At the same time, Howard's relentless tax reductions to buy elections have made Australia one of the lowest taxing developed countries.<br /><br />For the Labor party, which correctly spent up big as the GFC hit, straight to the people and businesses rather than by funding the banks, real government spending fell, in 2010-11 and 2012-13. Indeed the cut in government spending in 2012-13 is the largest cut ever recorded by percentage, not just by dollar amount.<br /><br />There were three years in the Hawke/Keating era where there were cuts in real government spending, so over the last 40 years, the Coalition have never once cut spending while the Labor Party has delivered real cuts in five of its budgets.<br /><br />Now, Abbott faces a contracting economy and exacerbates the contraction, in every way possible, yet the spending on such wasteful and foolish lose-lose things like wars and sea hunts for plane debris in the mighty Indian Ocean remain.<br /><br />The truth is something we all long for. That was some of it.</p>

	<p>Yes this tough budget approach by Labor under Swann/Wong to reduce spending has been written out of history somehow, probably pushed aside (certainly by the LNP for propaganda purposes) by the stimulus expenditure which on the whole is credited with being necessary and effective.</p>

	<p>The elephant in the room here is corporate tax and welfare. John Hewson's article addresses the responsibility of individuals through an increased GST and less access to tax concessions like superannuation. However, there is no mention of the dramatic national decline in corporate taxation revenues. <br /><br />The government of the future, because it is beyond this hamstrung government, needs to set a proportion of revenue expected from the corporate sector. The collection mechanism has to flow with growth and contractions like the GST for individuals. Any concessions need to be targeted by the government and business community into areas of development and potential growth under set and limited timeframes. <br /><br />Gone should be the days of carried forward losses, transfer pricing, accelerated depreciation and exemptions from fuel excise. If the big four banks, by way of example, have to pay their tax then they will ensure others will also pay theirs as there is a set expectation of the entire corporate sector.</p>

	<p>Terry2, the problem is it is not the company tax rate that is the problem.  The problem is that with all of the concessions and loopholes with the tax system too many companies do not even pay that tax rate.  <br /><br />If they are not paying that tax rate now it would not improve the budget outcome if we put the tax rate up.  All we would catch is those businesses who can't make use of those loopholes and shift their profits offshore.  All those loopholes in the tax system do is give those business, mainly multinationals, who can make use of them an uncompetitive advantage over those businesses who are unable to make use of them.</p>

	<p>&quot;while the Labor Party has delivered real cuts in five of its budgets.&quot;<br /><br />so you are saying that labor is the party that cuts, cuts, and then does more cuts ?<br /><br />cuts to education, cuts to health, cuts to employment, cuts to social security. Your saying that's labor ? <br /><br /><br />No wonder they got booted out of power.<br /><br /><br />but it didn't answer the question. is the person earning 250,000 limited to around 30,000 on super at 15% - which I expect is easily reached just by the standard super, let alone any salary sacrificing.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>I didn't agree with all of Labors cuts such as too the Uni sector but at least those cuts were to fund the Gonski School reforms .<br />Under Rudd/Gillard the number of on DSP actually fell ( ABC fact check) as eligibility was tightened .<br />Labor generally makes smarter cuts than the Libs ( slash and burn) , when Gillard increased the tax free threshold to $18,200 so an extra 1Mill people didn't pay income tax ( generally students ) well over a thousand ATO staff were cut , these were at lower  levels who handled the returns and input data , more were expected as Labor's plan to have more tax returns filed electronically . Labor generally improved systems before they made cuts.<br />Compare this to Abbott/Hockey before the Budget they cut several thousand including specialists from the ATO, in the budget they cut more from the ATO including 100 from  the Multinational Fraud and tax avoidance unit ( specialist lawyers and accountants many of whom were hird dy private companies at wages much higher than their govt salary) , outside experts said this was a mistake as it would cost up too $3B in lost tax a yr . Guess what Hockey announced last month that due to expected revenue losses of between  $1b and $3B from multinational comp tax avoidance , that 60 people people would be hire for this unit ( meanwhile the unit lost a lot of knowledge and momentum in investigations . <br /></p>

	<p>The amount for 2014-15 of concessional contributions to Super is $30K for under 50's and $35K for over 50's.<br /><br />The non concessional cap is however 6 times that amount. And any earnings on those funds are then also taxed at 15% instead of the taxpayer's normal marginal rate.<br /><br />Which makes for a very juicy carrot for those nearing retirement age and with tens (hundreds) of thousands of dollars to invest and taxes to dodge.</p>

	<p>The non-concessional contribution are made after tax, therefore the tax is already paid. Earnings on those funds are taxed at 15% to compensate for locking away income for many years. Without some incentive to put money into super would result in a reduction on money in super accounts and more reliance of the pension when retiring.</p>

	<p>Earnings are not taxed at 15% to compensate you for anything because it's a wilful decsion to put non concessional funds into Super, not forced savings like concessional contributions. <br />Seeing as around 40% of the total tax concessions given in Superannuation go to the top 10% of earners, the furphy about the reliance on the pension doesn't stack up. The top 10% of earners are not and should never be receiving the pension anyway.<br /><br />It's currently a rort, plain and simple.  Anyone that thinks the current concessions given in Super are fair or reasonable is kidding themselves, it's used as an effective savings vehicle for higher income earners to dodge their tax liabilities. I know, because I'm one of them.</p>

	<p>You never checked anything rb. You simply asserted something that is incorrect because that's what deniers do.<br /><br />That data came from an article by Stephen Koukoulas, quoting budget figures verbatim. There's no error. There's no spin.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, Howard also averaged a real spending growth of 4.3% after 2000 while during the Rudd/Gillard period real spending growth was only 3.4% on average, even allowing for the big increase during 2008/2009.<br /><br />Besides, if you have to go back to the beginning of the Howard years to find false or misleading data you really are admitting Koukoulas's facts are correct.<br /><br />You can't argue with finalized budget figures, unless you're innumerate like Alan Jones.</p>

	<p>rb: i haven't looked, but I 'suspect&quot; you say.<br /><br />If you did look, you would find that all the economic reforms that assisted Howard and Costello were in fact initiated by Keeting, who did have an overarching goal to advance the Australian economy.<br /><br />He rightly described the Howard years as being, &quot;hit in the arse by a rainbow&quot; in terms of the mining boom, and reaping the benefits of the economic reform he had put in place.<br /><br />It's well at truly time for the LNP supporters to believe the myth of superior economic management by the LNP, and look at the part that luck has played.<br /><br />That luck has now run out, and they are totally floundering, and doing exactly what will make things worse - trashing science and innovation, and new technologies for renewable energy.<br /><br />Hewson is right - they have NO plan for revenue, other than a GST, for which they would undoubtedly not compensate those on the lowest incomes, who pay the most.<br /><br />As far as super laws that benefit the very rich, especially in the way that Super is drawn, or changes to capital gains tax on property, and negative gearing - forget it.<br /><br />How will they deal with the burst of the housing bubble, and rising unemployment?<br /><br />There is NO PLAN for jobs, other than cutting them.<br /><br />A disaster is unfolding, the recession we did not have to have.</p>

	<p>FREEMAN,<br /><br />&quot;The ALP chose to increase spending during a time of falling revenue.&quot;<br /><br />That's right. Pubic revenue is dependent on DOMESTIC economic activity. Although some revenue comes from the proceeds of internatinal trade, it is effectively negligible.<br /><br />When capitalism experiences one of it's all-to-frequent market failures, economic activity around the globe goes into decline, which means that public revenue also goes into decline. If the decine is ignored, the economy will continue to retract and revenue will continue to fall. If you attempt to reduce your exposure by cutting spending (as the Greeks did), this supresses the domestic economy and, due to the &quot;multiplier effect&quot;, the decline in government revenue will be greater than the amount saved by spending cuts. In other words, cutting expenditure when revenues decline simply accelerates both the economic and fiscal decline. This is called a &quot;pro-cyclical&quot; response and, in the past, it has been responsible for the Great Depression and, more recently that disastrous and unnecessary recession caused by Fraser and Howard in the late seventies and early eighties.<br /><br />The correct response to a downturn in government revenue is to inject public revenue into the domestic market to boost domestic demand and thus domestic economic activity. In this way the decline in revenue can be minimised or even reversed. Again the &quot;muliplier&quot; effect kicks in, returning more to the government in revenue than they outlaid in stimulus spending. This is what we did in Australia, and it is why our economy continued to grow and why revenue continued to pour into government coffers.<br /><br />This meant that we had to take on some debt, largely because Howard squandered the proceeds of the longest boom in our history (set up by the Keating government) on disastrous social engineering projects that became structural costs in the budget. But it is only a very small debt (sort of like a person on $100,00 pa having a mortgate of $10,000 on a house worth $1,000,000), and it is manageable - unless some idiot decides to put on the brakes - and that is exactly what Hockey is trying to do.</p>

That is EXACTLY what I am talking about.<br /><br />investing is maintaining economic activity during a time of global recession is the most productive investment that a government can make - especially when this investment is made in such a way that it builds the productive capacity of the nation (like, for instance, modernising and expanding facilities in every school in Australia.<br /><br />But maintaining domestic demand with injections of public funds does far more than that. It also gives private and corporate investors confidence to keep investing, and to invest more in productive enterprises than in speculation on real estate.<br /><br />Anyway, the fact that you are now announcing yourself as an expert on what I think and say tends to suggest that you have run out of ideas of your own. Perhaps you should pay more attention to the integrity of your own ideas than to what you imagine that I may say or think.</p>

	<p>jay,<br /><br />&quot;We give far too much importance to capitalism. The industrial revolution and science played a huge part.&quot;<br /><br />I think that you are being a little dismissive of capitalism's contribution to civilisation.<br /><br />Capitalism was made possible by the Industrial Revolution and scientific advances, and these were made possible by capitalism. You can't really talk about one without acknowledging the others.<br /><br />Capitalism's great strength was it's capacity to drive the rapid expansion of the economy and productive capacity. Even if the necessary scientific and mechanical advances of the Industrial Revolution could have happened under feudalism, it would not have led to the same rapid expansion that was experienced under capitalism.<br /><br />As I said, capitalism's great strength is its ability to drive rapid expansion of the economy and its productive capacity. It's great weakness, however, is in not being able to stop expanding. Most of the problems of the 20th Century (the most disastrous in our history) are the result of our failure to realise that capitalism had reached its use-by date by the end of the 19th Century. By then it had expanded as far as it could go. The edges of the world had been reached,<br /><br />We need to move on, not because capitalism is evil or a bad system, but simply because it has, like every mode of production before it, created the conditions for its own obsolescence.</p>

	<p>&quot;We give far too much importance to capitalism. The industrial revolution and science played a huge part.&quot;<br /><br />The ancient Greeks had steam engines (toys) and clockwork. The Romans had aqueducts, canals and water mill powered industrial complexes, but no Industrial Revolution. <br /><br />The Industrial Revolution was intimately coupled to social and economic innovations too, including capitalism. Before it was entirely captured by corporatism and the new oligarchy, capitalism was a genuinely innovative driver for growth during the Industrial Revolution. Technical innovation alone isn't enough to explain it. <br /><br />Of course the modern form has lost most of its good points and retained all of its bad ones.</p>

	<p>SVJ,<br /><br />&quot;the government only needs to spend a little money for people to return more of the pudding back in revenue&quot;<br /><br />That is pretty much how it works.<br /><br />You see, the economy is not just a static balance sheet. It is a hugely complex &quot;chaotic&quot; system.<br /><br />Chaotic systems have some rather interesting behaviours. We owe our very existence (and that of our universe) to chaos. Without chaos, there is no possibility of order and without order there is no possibility of the complex structures required for life to exist of ever emerging.<br /><br />You express some scepticism about the idea that a small variation in inputs can have an enormous effect on outputs, but that is precisely the sort of behaviour that you expect from chaotic systems.<br /><br />But to understand how multipliers work in the economy, you have to understand that the economy is not just chaotic, it is dynamically unstable. In other words, a small deviation from the point of equilibrium will produce a greater tendency to diverge, and this tendency to diverge will increase progressively with distance from equilibrium.<br /><br />If the government puts a dollar in the pocket of a poor person, that person will spend the dollar. If there are enough dollars in the pockets of enough poor people, the cumulative effect of all that extra spending power will be a noticeable lift in demand, which keeps businesses open and people in jobs. When businesses are open and people are working they pay tax, invest in new plant and equipment and so on. They have the confidence to borrow money for investment, and this leads to more economic activity still. The government saves money on social security because more people are in work, and receives more revenue from people who are working and businesses whose doors are still open thanks to the stimulus.<br /><br />The secret is a phenomenon called &quot;feedback&quot; and it is central to understanding chaotic systems. I suggest that, before you sneer at things of which you clearly have no understanding, you should really learn how they work - if you really wish to avoid looking as foolish as your loast post made you look.</p>

	<p>I agree with you v.<br /><br />A nation's economy is a lot more complicated than simple mathematics. Most people are willing to borrow far more money than they can earn in many years of work to buy a house. <br /><br />Look at any country or even city that supports itself through the endeavours of its inhabitants. Food and basic resources go into the population and in turn that population interacts with each other to create wealth far beyond the worth of the food and raw material that went into it.<br /><br />This simplistic government and all LCP/LNPs since Menzies, have gained power by frightening people into voting for them by claiming labour can't manage an economy.<br /><br />The truth is that Labour have been far better economic managers and more importantly have given the population far more &quot;wealth&quot; than money can buy. (i.e social equality, a fair and comfortable lifestyle that all Aussies want and deserve). Liberals look after the wealthy because they have no social conscience or idea how to better our society other than purely through simplistic money management. <br /><br />Even this doesn't work because they can't see past their stupid purpose in life to make the rich even richer at the expense of those in society who can't generate money from anything but their own efforts.</p>

	<p>weed,<br /><br />&quot;I agree with you v.&quot;<br /><br />So I'm not crazy then. Phew! Thanks for that.<br /><br />The big problem for the LNP is that they just about all come from a management background, with a distinct bias toward accountancy and corporate law. And modern management has been reduced by ideology into a slightly complicated join-the-dots game in which the goal is to produce a set of static numbers on a balance sheet.<br /><br />Static numbers may be fine for accountancy purposes, but they are worse than useless as a basis for managing an economy. For that you need to be able to think in terms of behaviours in an atmosphere of constant flux.<br /><br />It's sort of like the difference between Euclidean geometry and calculus. Euclid's geometry is fine for shapes that don't change. But if you want to find out the trajectory of an artillery shell, you need something that can handle changing numbers, acceleration, aerodynamic drag and so on.<br /><br />You can figure out whether or not your business made a profit by looking at a balance sheet. You cannot understand how an economy works by looking at a balance sheet. For that, you need more sophisticated tools that can deal with the chaotic nature of large, complex systems.<br /><br />But the very idea of change is anathema to conservative dogma. So they prefer to reduce any discussion of the economy to an argument over the arithmetic of balance sheets. That is what they understand. It is the limit of their intellect. So you can't really blame them.</p>

	<p>Throughout the boom period when tax receipts grew dramatically, Treasury repeatedly pointed out that the  Howard Government should be putting more into infrastructure spending.  This would have had two significant benefits over what Howard and Costello did.  Firstly the infrastructure spend is one off in nature and thus does not do structural damage to the budget as Howard's tax cuts did. Secondly, appropriately targeted infrastructure development leads to increased productivity.  I can remember reading a number of Treasury papers, one by Gruen I think, virtually pleading for the Goverment to divert their windfall tax receipts into infrastructure, but Howard instead decided to buy votes.<br /><br />I well remember a article by Ross Giitins in which he summed up Peter Costeelo's contribution as Treasurer: &quot; The economy did much more for Peter Costello than Peter Costello did for the economy.&quot;</p>

	<p>As another poster has noted RayS you should look at the early years of the Howard government - they clearly reduced spending then. In the 2000's it did go the other way. As for Rudd/Gilliard - cuts in spending are pretty easy to achieve when one is coming off the mother of all cash handouts. Stimulus Mark 1 was excellent policy - but the rest was wasted cash. Coming off that doesn't represent any real saving measures.</p>

	<p>firthy,<br /><br />&quot;Stimulus Mark 1 was excellent policy &quot;<br /><br />Which would have been entirely wasted had Swan stopped there and rested on his laurels. I agree that the speed of the response to the initial shock was important and saved us tens of billions of dollars, but it was not sufficient to SUSTAIN the stimularoy effect for anywhere near long enough.<br /><br />You see, the GFC may be over in Australia, but the US is still shelling out tems of billions PER MONTH in order to keep their economy afloat because they couldn't decide whether to stimulate the economy or cut spending and, in the end they spent their stimulus money on propping up businesses that we &quot;too big to fail&quot;. And Europe is in even more dire straits.<br /><br />Our economy is still in good shape (not as good as this time last year, but good) largely as a result of the supplememntary measures taken after &quot;Stimulus mark 1&quot;. Without that, we would still be madly borrowing money to spend on stimulating a comatose economy.<br /><br />as they say in the classics: a stitch in time saves nine.</p>

	<p>SVJ,<br /><br />&quot;In OZ throwing cash around saved us all, in the US it's done zip because.....&quot;<br /><br />Well, first of all, throwing cash around would not have helped at all, so it is lucky that Swan didn't do that.<br /><br />The Australian response saved the budget billions of dollars by ensuring that public revenues remained strong right from the start. It is also important to look at the targetting, as this will be rather important when we get around to explaining why the US response was not as successful as ours.<br /><br />The Australian response was multi-faceted and involved some measures that, while highly effective, didn't cost a cent to implement (the bank guarantee for instance). But the focus of it centred around two key strategies.<br /><br />The first was to inject money directly into the hands of those who were most likely to spend the whole lot (or pay down their personal, private debts). This was done via the cash grant in the early stages of the GFC. This is the bit that &quot;firthy&quot; thinks was brilliant.<br /><br />The second was to engage in infrastructure projects that would have the secondary effect of improving Australia's productive capacity in the long term. And this is where projects like the BER were important.<br /><br />You see, there are schools all over Australia. Every community has at least one. Rolling out infrastructure projects in each and every one ensured that there were workers in every town who needed to buy lunch. It also kept these workers in jobs, which kept them off social security and ensured that they continued to pay tax. The businesses who remained open as a result employed people who would otherwise have been receiving unemployment benefits.<br /><br />The US response did't work as well because there was a delay in implementation (vacillation and too much listening to TEA Party naysayers). The eventual shape of the stimulus, which went almost entirely to big business, did little to stimulate consumer demand or, as it turns out, save any jobs.<br /><br />So, that is why.<br /><br />Everybody knows that you hit a cricket ball with a cricket bat. But that doesn't make everybody Dave Warner. To get results, the bat must be handled with courage and skill, and that is what Swan did with fiscal policy. He knocked the GFC for six.</p>

	<p>V, you are on the mark regarding the BER. I did a considerable amount of research on the impact off the BER on the bottom line of the budget using standard construction industry parameters eg proportion costs applied to materials, wages, average construction industry wages,profits and industry multipliers.  I also assumed a 10 % price premium.  The Orgill report I think found that a premium of 7 % had been paid, which he found to be reasonable in view of the speed with which the project was implemented.  I also used the Master Builders of Australia (MBA) Economist's estimate of the jobs saved by the BER. On their website it stated that without the BER,there would have a collapse of the construction industry with up to 35,000 jobs lost.  <br /><br />My calculation was that even writing off 10% of the project's value, $1.6 billion, there was a net benefit to the budget of around $600 million.  So much for the moron's at the Australian bleating about waste and the &quot;failed BER&quot;.  The BER program played a huge part in saving Australia from recession,  provided much needed infrastructure to schools and yet the Coalition still portrays it as a a &quot;Labor disaster&quot;.</p>

	<p>I can see a miniscule monetary reduction in government spending in '97 firthy, but then it went up solidly in '98.<br /><br />My statement was about real spending, which relates to the value of the monetary amount of spending in relation to its purchasing power (roughly speaking).<br /><br />It also happens that the CPI for Australia went negative in '97 for most of the year, which accounts for the real spending being higher than the monetary spending and also reflects poorly on Howard's first budget negative impact on the economy.<br /><br />My initial comment, re Howard (and Costello) never having a single budget of their 12 budgets in which real spending was reduced, is correct.</p>

	<p>Low taxes are good. High levels of spending are not. We need to CUT SPENDING. Problem is that with a populist Senate, that is never going to happen. So ANY move need Greens or ALP support.<br /><br />Even higher taxes are out ? do people recall the fuel excise being rejected by the ALP as the Libs promised not to raise taxes. Yet the income tax went through ? so that can be the only source of revenue growth. Now, raising income taxes to say 50 cents for the over 80k bracket and say 60 cents for the over 180k bracket would be required to balance the budget if we continue to spend on each and every good cause known to man. And although Hewson argued for lower income taxes as part of Fightback, I am sure now that he works for the ANU, that higher taxes and higher spending are the answer to everything. <br /><br />Personally, I prefer less taxes and less spending. When Hewson bitterly reflects that Howard &quot;spent&quot; the spoils of the boom, he is misleading readers. He GAVE IT BACK TO INDIVIDUALS. What part of that does a University Professor not understand? Those individuals can then choose to save/invest or spend that money. ?Government spending? would be like the NDIS or other increases in Government spending. Just as tax increases are NOT savings. No, savings actually require some reduction of spending, calling them savings is misleading.<br /><br />What we cannot do as a nation is continue to grow the role of increasingly incompetent Governments. One could look to improving the quality of our political leadership. I argue for politicians getting pay commensurate with the private sector and am looked at like I have genuinely lost my mind - so that is NOT going to happen. Therefore, we need to take it as a given that those charged with making these massive financial decisions are going to be mediocre at best (why would anyone with a brain and options choose that role?). Private business just has a more rational model. That is, they will pay for the best and shareholders are happy to pay an appropriate salary because they know that $20m might sound like a lot, but not if the presence of that exceptional leader means a bottom line that is $20,000,001 or more better at the end of the day. How much would we save if Hockey?s job was paying $20m pa and therefore all the best heads were fighting for the job? I say BILLIONS would be saved. Whereas voters get all excited where a pollie claims a couple of grand too much, but have no problems when poor decisions cost us BILLIONS. The public sector and private sector are just too different beasts and people seem to act differently around each. Therefore, the larger the role of Government, the worse the social and economic outcomes for the majority of Australian families. If we cannot tame the public beast, we can at least stop feeding it so much.<br /></p>

	<p>Todd,<br /><br />&quot;Low taxes are good. High levels of spending are not.&quot;<br /><br />When and where? Under what circumstances? During a recession or when demand is overheating the economy?<br /><br />Your statement is a bit like saying &quot;Human beings need iodine therefore everybody should eat as much iodine as they can&quot;.<br /><br />Let's have a look at two countries - one that has low taxes (Haiti) and one that has high taxes (Sweden). Now, Todd, imagine for a while that Australia is beset by some large crisis that turns us into refugees. We are all sitting in a camp somewhere in Somalia, and the UNHCR gives us a choice of being resettled in Haiti or Sweden. Which one would you choose - the one with the low taxes or the one with the high standard of living?<br /><br />There is also a country in which the necessity for taxation has been all but eliminated by a more efficient mode of production (socialism): Cuba. The standard of living in Cuba is closer to Sweden's than to Haiti's, but is still not as good as Sweden's (yet). The fact that the country with the lowest tax sits between two higher taxing countries in terms of standard of living suggests that levels of taxation and government expenditure are poor predictors of economic outcomes.<br /><br />Taxation should be a reflection of what it costs to run a country, and should also be used to resist the natural tendency in capitalist economies for wealth to accumulate unproductively.<br /><br />Public spending should follow an inverse relationship with economic activity. The weaker the activity the more the need for public spending to maintain and stimulate domestic demand. When activity is strong, there is a need to reduce public spending, or at least not increase it, so that the economy does not overheat, leading to runaway inflation like that experienced under Fraser and Howard.</p>

	<p>@Todd, I must say that you make a good argument in regards to the pay for politicians being increased. Especially for the role of treasurer but they all should be paid more.<br /><br />The only issue I have is that being good at business doesn't make a good politician. When the GFC hit the government thankfully under Labor did what was required to boost the economy rather than cut expenses like a business would need to do. The austeroty in Europe is very much a business mindset that has them stuck in recession and likely deflation. A complete mess and so cruel to a whole generation of young people in particular.<br /><br />I recommend Paul Krugman's blog on the NYtimes for anyone interested in what is wrong with the EU and the USA stimulus that was 3x too small and the republican's that never let Obama do what was required purely for political (and arguably racist) reasons.</p>

	<p>Nice to see someone who pays attention to reality instead of the political sloganeering. Labor has indeed out performed the Coalition in many economic areas that are beloved of capitalists. That those capitalists still put faith in a party that was last rated by the IMF as 'the most profligate government in Australia's history' shows that even the 'business minded' types vote against their own best interests. Small business people should never vote for the party that is captive of the big end of town. <br /><br />If you look at Australia's ratings against the rest of the world, we go up during Labor and down during the Coalition. The Coalition have been extremely lucky to be in power during the good times. Now they have power during uncertain times and all they seem to want to do is destroy government and hand power over to their big business mates.</p>

	<p>Yes Ray<br />I find the policies of this LNP government unusual and somewhat alarming. Take the graincorp fiasco and SPC Joyce the Ag minister nowhere to be seen he always appears after the event with some weasel words. The destruction of the vehicle manufacturing industry is another area where the LNP has fallen down. They don't know the difference between a subsidy and an investment. The car industry generated at least 10 billion a year for a 300million investment. Not good economics especially for our future. The longer this mob goes the harder it will be to come back from the havoc and destruction caused by the LNP.</p>

	<p>What I really can't understand is the finance 101 class they missed out on.  I liken it to someone buying a new house to move into prior to selling their current one.<br /><br />Why on earth would you scrap the revenue making side eg carbon tax and mining tax, before you scrap the expenditure side???? Makes no sense.  Obviously the senate swing is held by popularist mining senator who would gladly get rid of a tax on his business, but not the benefits.<br /><br />I just don't get it.  Any normal person would say, I need to remove Spending A before I can get rid of Revenue A. Oh wait, the senate won't allow me to get rid of Expenditure A therefore I can't get rid of Revenue A.....  Arrrgghhhh!!!! Simple I tell you!</p>

	<p>Fish,<br /><br />I agree that there is a certain degree of confusion about the LNP harping on about getting rid of the carbon tax and the mining tax.   To be fair to them, however, when they got rid of the mining tax they did manage to get through a number of cuts on items that were supposed to have been paid for by it.   They fell down with the carbon tax repeal because Mr Abbott told us that we could keep the compensation we received when the carbon tax came in.   So in this respect the LNP had a severe brain fade.  It should have been quite simple: lose the tax and lose the compensation.   An eminently arguable position.  But once again Mr Abbott backed the LNP into a corner by making a promise he didn't have to.<br /><br />The joke is that the electorate wont thank him for removing the taxes.  As far as we're concerned it's done and dusted.   And any reduction in electricity prices and other costs will be forgotten about after a couple of billing cycles.   So they took action that depleted the budgetary position, created a situation in which some sort of policy reversal will be inevitable and forgot about the short term mindset of the electorate that will ignore the &quot;good&quot; things the LNP have delivered when it comes time to vote again.  The strategy they've used only works when you haven't done anything that we don't like.   In politics negatives olways outweigh positives when it comes to voting.</p>

	<p>&quot;But isn't the low tax rate on super limited to $25k&quot;<br /><br />It's $40k if you are over 50. So if you are on the top marginal tax rate, that's a saving of 32.5 cents in the dollar, or $13,000 per year. If you are planning to retire at 60 or so, that is free money and even middle income earners can take advantage of it. Maybe the receiving of such super concessions should result in a decrease in the eventual pension means test, to discourage those who have claimed concessional super from taking world trips or giving money/property to their offspring then claiming the pension. <br /><br />The real problem though, is that the earnings of super funds are not taxed. This costs the Govt squillions.<br /><br />It would not be fair to tax the super earnings of low or even medium income earners, but when you have $1m or more in super, tax should be payable on fund earnings.<br /></p>

	<p>&quot;The real problem though, is that the earnings of super funds are not taxed. This costs the Govt squillions.&quot;<br />When I was working I paid 15% on the earnings and I think most will be the same? Some changes may be required but constant tinkering with superannuation laws to meet the next budgetary problem will never be the answer and does nothing but undermine people's confidence in the system.  <br />Also I think you will find that quite a few 'medium' income earners who have planned responsibly may have in excess of $1m at or approaching retirement and good luck to them. <br />Too many have left planning to the last minute or not thought about it at all, ask people you know and be surprised. I know quite a few and who now envious of others, some angry that these people not unlike successful people generally, got on top of a problem early.<br /></p>

	<p>Graham,<br /><br />&quot;replace 120 odd different taxes with 10 mains ones.&quot;<br /><br />Taken at face value, this statement is essentially meaningless. It tells us nothing about whether this would have helped the situation or made it worse.<br /><br />Just imagine if you awoke from surgery to be told by the surgeon that: &quot;I did a brillant job! I relaced 120 different body parts with 10 main ones!&quot;. Would you expect to live for long? And what if your mechanic told you the same thing about your car? Would you still consider it to be roadworthy? What if one of the &quot;minor&quot; parts removed was vital to the car's braking system?<br /><br />This obsession with simplification is a trademark of Tory policy. The problem is that, not only does it allow for huge errors to be made, but the number of corrective measures required to return the system to dunctionality creates more complication than it originally removed.<br /><br />The GST is a classic example of this. It was SUPPOSED to replace all indirect Federal taxes and the vast majority of state taxes with one simple tax. But then there had to be exemptions (not for the sake of fairness, but just so that it would work in practice). And then the state governments found all sorts of reasons for not abolishing taxes (there are more state taxes now than there were before the GST). But the worst effect was to force the burden of compliance all the way down to the individual small business operators and sole traders, placing what was in come cases a crippling administrative burden on enterprises that would otherwise have remained viable.<br /><br />The introduction of the GST also sent the economy into reverse, making it necessary to stimulate the economy. Howard's chosen method was to introduce a $7,000 grant to people buying houses, which immediately raised the price of a house by $7,000 and triggered a mad speculative boom in house prices that forced first home buyers out of the market.<br /><br />Sometimes things get stuck in the system that no longer have a prupose or serve their purpose, and these should be judiciously pruned whenever this is possible. But the sort of wholesale &quot;simplification&quot; you advocate is likely to produce so many unintended consequences that only a madman would give it serious contemplation.</p>

	<p>Very ridiculous post, failing to counter V's points, which are fundamentally correct. Unintended consequences follow the cornering of business, tax and legal advice by the wealthy in their own interests only. Laws change in substance, interpretation and revision or replacement by the powerful, usually. Lobbies rise and rise, but not by ordinary taxpayers. Howard was completely inadequate as a treasurer or economics thinker; my old classmate was a dud at maths and economics. Old Ernie Pillans, our teacher, would have collapsed in laughter at the dream of Howard as treasurer. Mirth indeed.</p>

	<p>Graham,<br /><br />&quot;Brilliant really. But plain logical.&quot;<br /><br />No, just an unproven idea with nothing to support it.<br /><br />You need to put a bit of flesh on the bones of your &quot;argument&quot; - simply asserting that you are right is no substitute for substance, I am afraid.<br /><br />Please let us know exactly HOW abolishing all of those taxes would achieve ANY desirable result at all. Which taxes were going to be abolished, why were they introduced, how much money do they raise, what other social function do they serve? How will getting rid of them save money or stimulate the economy? And you should be able to answer for EACH tax whose abolition you are proposing.<br /><br />I have already demonstrated how a plan to replace a whole menagerie of indirect taxes with a single GST misfired badly, creating more taxes than existed before, making home ownership unaffordable and destroying thousands of otherwise viable small businesses. And what have you offered in return? Just more of the same insulting, tiny-minded garbage.<br /><br />You are going to have to try harder than that.</p>

	<p>olive,<br /><br />&quot;The old wholesale tax method was not complicated but it was good because it was progressive.&quot;<br /><br />No strictly true, but is was certainly less regressive than an across-the-board consumer tax.<br /><br />Wholesale sales tax was mainly levied on luxuries, but this does not make it progressive. A poor person still had to pay the same amount of sales tax on a bottle of champagne as a rich person, which means that they were paying a larger part fo their income than was a rich person. While it is true that a rich person is more likely to lash out on champagne than a poor person, there was no prohibition on poor people purchasing champagne and imposing a sales tax on it simply put champagne further out of the reach of a poor person that it would otherwise have been.<br /><br />But the idea is to replace the GST with a tax (or taxes) that will actually do some good by ensuring that wealth cannot accumulate unproductively and that monopolies cannot grow and coalesce. Wealth and land taxes are the most effective way of doing this, and these should be fully investigated to get the right mix for Australia.</p>

	<p>Not just on luxury items at all v.  Whenever I went to my plumbing supplies (usually for water filters for our tank rainwater) there was a tax on the filters - it was itemised.  I doubt the poor bought real champagne v - more likely a bottle of decent Aussie sparkling.  The wholesale tax had a number of percentages and the higher rates went on luxury goods just as they should.</p>

	<p>Gregory,<br /><br />&quot;You propose to ditch the GST then. And go back to the other complicated method.&quot;<br /><br />Yes I think that the abolition of the GST would be an excellent idea but, rather than just reverting to the old system of lots of wholesales taxes and other indirect charges, we should take the opportunity to think a little about why we are taxed and how taxation can be used to make the economy function better.<br /><br />We are currently experiencing (on a global scale at least) one of the frequent failures of the capitalist market. We know why these market failures occur - we have known for 150 years at least. These failures are caused by the unproductive accumulation of wealth outside the consumer market (the consumer market not only drives the economy - it gives it a reason to exist), which lead to a &quot;demand drought&quot; as consumers do not have enough liquid wealth to purchase all that is produced, leading to build-ups in invetories that lead to slow-downs in production, labour shedding and a further reduction of liquid wealth in the market place.<br /><br />Taxation that has the effect of re-mobilising the ossified wealth outside of the market and re-injecting it into the market where it can be used to create demand, cannot totally eliminate all chances of wealth coagulating in corporate coffers, but it can considerably slow down the rate at which this occurs and this allows for longer periods of relative prosperity between the inevitable crashes.<br /><br />So, rather than replacing one regressive tax that takes money out of the consumer market with another regressive tax that takes money out of the consumer market, we would be much better off taxing idle wealth in the form of land and bank accounts. And we would also be better off looking for ways of preventing the generation of super-profits, which are the root cause of both the ossification of idle wealth and the consolidation of monopoly power in progressively fewer hands.<br /><br />Taxation can be used, not just to raise revenue, but to dampen and mollify the negative effects of our dysfunctional economic system on human citizens - and it should be.</p>

	<p>V, indeed the GST was supposed to cull all inefficient state directed taxes. However, those taxes were to be dropped on the back of a broad based GST/Consumption Tax. The actuality was something different. In order to get through the Houses, exemptions to certain sectors (health, fresh food etc) had to be made. We are now left with legislation that is littered with rulings, amendments court cases. What should have been a easily managed tax was bastardised.<br /><br />As to the FHBG. This was introduced and was to be an interim measure to compensate for the projected cost increase of a new dwelling. It, however, became a political vote grabber by both sides of the political fence at both a state and national level.<br /><br />And as to simplification, I have seen several attempts. The last was the Henry Review - mentioned elsewhere. However, we do not have the political will, the brains nor the balls to see it through. Instead we will continue to pile continued amendments, rulings and court cases on our cumbersome ITAA.<br /></p>

	<p>Tax,<br /><br />&quot;However, those taxes were to be dropped on the back of a broad based GST/Consumption Tax. The actuality was something different.&quot;<br /><br />That's exactly what I was talking about - a simple idea that was entirely unpractical and, when implemented did not even match the original idea. But the simple thing is that, had Howard had his way and made the tax apply across the board, the effect on economic activity would have been even more severe, requiring even more severe and extreme &quot;pump-priming&quot; and an even higher outlay on social security, health and education than anticipated.<br /><br />You see, this is the bit that the Tories will never understand. The distinction between the economy and society is largely an illusion that we entertain for the sake of simplicity. But, in reality, you cannot separate the economy from society or its politics. A failure to implement an economic measure that has been caused by a failure of politics (which is essentially what you are accusing Howard of) is still a failure of economic policy. The GST has been an expensive and highly damaging failure because it could only ever work in theory, where only the balance sheet counts and this can be isolated from the real world. In order to get it into practice, Howard made compromises that changed the nature of the tax and ensured its failure.<br /><br />So, the result of the introduction of the GST was a stagnant economy, an unsustainable housing bubble, the loss of the &quot;great Australian dream&quot; (home ownership), and chronic underfunding of the states. It has totally failed to achieve even one of its stated aims.</p>

Cars simply do not have 110 parts that &quot;do nothing&quot;. They were all put there for a purpose. You may have forgotten or be unaware of the function that they perform, but until you can confirm their redudancy, the only sensible thing to do is to keep them in place and continue to maintain them as required.<br /><br />Look at it this way.<br /><br />We used to be told that we only use about 10% of our brains, so 90% is redundant. We now know that this is nonsense and that every bit of the brain has a function to perform and that thinking and consciousness actually involve much more than just the brain.<br /><br />Now, imagine if some neursurgeon back in the 1960's (when this ridiculous assertion was popular) had suggested that we could all be made much healthier if we had the &quot;redundant&quot; part of our brain removed, thus making our head lighter and relieving stress on our backs. With what we know now about thinking and consciousness, this would have been more than just a little faux-pas.<br /><br />The same can be said for DNA which, until a few years ago, was considered to be made up mostly of &quot;junk&quot; - that was, until the science of epigenetics arose and informed us as to the actual uses and purposes of &quot;junk DNA&quot;.<br /><br />I'm not saying that no existing taxes should be abolished - as a matter of fact, I am a great supporter to scrapping the GST and other forms of indirect tax. But, before deciding purely on the basis of how big they are, to scrap 90% of all taxes, it would be a good idea to actually find out what EACH tax does and how that function will continue to be served if the tax is abolished.<br /><br />Simply praising something because it reduces a number from 110 to 10 is just nonsensical - which is probably why the Henry Review didn't recommend anything of the sort.<br /><br />You are simply making it up as you go along.</p>

	<p>It would help if you actually waded through the report, its terms of reference, recommendations etc.  Many recommendations were implemented and many recommendations were for the status quo.  Nowhere will you find anything saying that we should have ten all emcompassing taxes.  You're writing BS Graham H in both your posts.</p>

	<p>Many of the recommendations were to do with whether or not various tax deductions should stay or go.  A good number were State matters.  Others were noteworthy, such as 'Recommendation 117: The government should ensure that sufficient resources are devoted to the functions of the Inspector-General of Taxation, the Australian National Audit Office and the Commonwealth Ombudsman, recognising their importance in maintaining a fair and efficient tax system.'   Right now Abbott &amp; Co are cutting staff everywhere.  Do you think Abbott/Hockey should study the Henry Review?</p>

	<p>Keating tried to abolish negative gearing once. And that is what happened. Rent went up.<br /><br />You seem to look at negative gearing on its own.  Without looking at the chain of reaction to cancelling it. And you over rate its importance.<br /><br />What will an Existing investor do if its scrapped.  They still wont sell due to Capital Gains tax. So status quo. No price decreases.  But less tax loss claimed.   <br /><br />if you think negative gearing is such an incentive to invest -  Like wise you think New investors wont come on board if negative gearing is scrapped.  I doubt that anyway.  But it is not critical to the outcome.<br /><br />Australian population is growing at around 300,000  a year.?<br /><br />Prices remain high - no extra housing on market - more in need of housing.<br /><br />Up goes rent.<br /><br />negative gearing would be better grandfathered out from a certain date - and then only apply to NEW BUILD housing.  That may help the supply problem and hence stop rental hikes.</p>

About 1985-87<br /><br />The main claim factor in negative gearing is loan interest.<br /><br />So ditching negative gearing - has actually not been tried.<br /><br />id like to see it tried.

	<p>Negative gearing makes it possible to rent a house for less than the true opportunity cost of owning it. This is why renters who buy find that they are paying considerably more in loan repayments, rates, insurance, etc etc.<br /><br />Therefore negative gearing of housing is in effect a subsidy to renters. This balances the subsidy to home owners/occupiers that is provided by the CGT exemption of the residential home.<br /><br />You take away negative gearing on housing, landlords would either have to become charities by renting properties at less than their cost, or increase rents so that they reflect the true cost of property ownership.<br /><br />You take away negative gearing on housing, its only fair you also bring in CGT on the residential home.<br /><br />As far as saving the Government money, it's by no means certain this will happen.

	<p>Your assertion that negative gearing makes it possible to rent a house for less then the opportunity cost of buying it is absolute f**king rubbish<br /><br />The whole idea of negative gearing is so you can claim both interest and the cost of maintaining the property against other income<br /><br />The problem is generally these people don't own house they quite often end up with three or four which means not only are these houses not available for sale but the government is paying a hell of a lot of tax back to very few people<br /><br />And if the house that are rented were available to the market then the overall price of houses would drop which means that the mortgages would be lower<br /><br />All negative gearing is is a tax rort very the lucky few that unnecessarily caused house cost inflation<br /><br />if you really wanted to help out you make the mortgage interest on all houses tax deductible<br /></p>

	<p>Graham,<br /><br />&quot;I hope those who want negative gearing gone are Ok with the rent increases due to lack of supply of rental housing.&quot;<br /><br />The two ideas are not linked. An increase in rents is not a guaranteed consequence of the removal of negative gearing.<br /><br />Removing negative gearing is not just the sensible thing to do in terms of fiscal rectitude - it has the effect of discouraging idle speculation in residential real estate. It is this speculation that has caused a huge blowout in housing costs, and not just for renters. Removing the incentives from idle speculation will reduce demand for &quot;investment properties&quot; and drive housing prices down. This, in turn will reduce demand for rental properties, as it will place the goal of home ownership within the reach of a larger percentage of the population. And, as you know, reduced demand leads to lower prices (or rents).<br /><br />If we want to be a prosperous and economically independent country, we have to start concentrating on PRODUCING new wealth, not just shuffling old wealth around through property transations and other forms of idle speculation. And we are unlikely to achieve this when artificial sweetners like negative gearing and the first homebuyers grant make idle speculation a more attractive investment option than investing in productive capital and infrastructure.<br /><br />Of course, some of the money wasted on negative gearing could also be spent on improving our stocks of public housing, which would place further downward pressure on rents. Overall, it is a win-win situation for government, homeowners and renters. The only real losers are the parasites who attempt to sponge off society with their idle speculation, and the money-lenders. And it's about time someone chased them out of the temple anyway.</p>

	<p>Graham,<br /><br />&quot;Keating reversed his decision to cancel negative gearing.&quot;<br /><br />Simple, It was one of his few errors. He should have stuck to his guns and taken punitive action against landlords who raised their rents using negative gearing as an excuse. He should also have dedicated the money saved to boosting public housing and placing competitive pressure on the leaches.<br /><br />Rudd and Gillard had other fish to fry. Abolishing negative gearing would be a wonderful reform, but it has never exactly been at the top of the priority list.<br /><br />It will be abolished, and it will be abolished by a Labor government, but it will happen when such things can be achieved without derailing other, more central parts of the programme.<br /><br />Abbott could abolish it tomorrow. Perhaps you could speed things up by getting your electorate office to put pressure on him.</p>

	<p>Graham H, Keating reversed his decision on negative gearing in  part because the rentiers (FIRE economy participants) held the megaphone to the public ear and said the sky was going to fall.<br />Saul Eslake has written many articles about the fallacy of using negative gearing for other than new build or new share purchase.<br />Gillard and Rudd were, like most politicians then and today, heavily invested in property. I think Rudd even tried to get 'Ruddbank' up and running to cover a potential financial collapse in commercial property. They were part of the comprised mess that constitutes politicians who are little more than vested interests holding public office.<br />Changing the rules around negative gearing has to happen if any semblance of a functioning economy is to exist long term.</p>

	<p>Agree Jilleene<br />People tend to forget that building and maintaining public housing costs far more than what it brings in and that the money to build comes from borrowing from the international community.<br />In other words to provide that new build 3 bedroom townhouse the government has paid probably around $400k and is getting only 25% of the houshold income which is a fraction of what the market rental value is. They then have an ongoing maintenance cost well above what market rentals tend to have.<br />Public housing, though necessary, costs the government a fortune.</p>

	<p>Jane,<br /><br />&quot;People tend to forget that building and maintaining public housing costs far more than what it brings in and that the money to build comes from borrowing from the international community.&quot;<br /><br />It is not as if money won't be borrowed if no housing is built.<br /><br />Per dwelling, public housing is less expensive than privately-built and managed housing. So, if you replace 100 public dwelling with 100 private dwellings, more money will have to be borrowed to pay for them, and this money will be borrowed overseas. AND, because public debt is more secure than private debt, the government can borrow money at much lower itnerest rates than private investors, so the net effect on our current account is lower if the government invests in public housing than if it leaves it up to the private sector.<br /><br />While it is best to have no foreign debt at all, if you have to have debt (and Australia has NEVER been debt free), it is best for that debt to be carried by the government because this has the smallest effect on our current account.<br /><br />The other big advantqage of public housing is that it takes pressure off scant investment dollars, making it easier and less risky for private investors to invest their money in productive enterprises rather than simply gambling on the housing market. One of the biggest brakes on growth in Australia has always been the huge chunk of available investment funds being swallowed by credit for real-estate transactions. If this money could be redirected from idel speculation to productive investment, our economy would grow much faster, providing the government with more revenue to build more public housing.<br /><br />This is not a choice between spending money on public housing and not spending money at all. It is a choice between a small, efficient and self-replenishing investment of public funds, and the waste of trillions of our hard-earned on interest payments for loans to the private sector that do nothing to increase our productive capacity.</p>

But those waiting for prices to drop so they can race in and buy are likely to be disappointed, I suspect.<br /><br />All of this is moot, as no Government will take this step in the foreseeable future.  <br /><br /></p>

	<p>&quot;Do you really think existing investors will get out en masse and there'll be a collapse in house prices?&quot;<br /><br />It depends. If the capital gains tax concessions were also removed then more investors will get out. If the economy takes a downturn then a smart property investor would realise there might be better returns elsewhere, and if so you should expect to see increasing numbers of sales.<br /><br />&quot;You are stopping new players coming in....In the fullness of time, you'd see a rental shortage&quot;<br /><br />New players are not adding to the stock of housing, and havent for quite some time. They buy existing properties and in doing so prevent would be owner occupiers from buying them.<br /><br />Every 'new player' that is prevented from joining in is a good thing for every renter who would like to buy their own place.<br /><br />But it is not just about affordable housing, it is the 3 billion or so that the government loses in revenue every year to support negative gearing. That would go a long way towards balancing the budget.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>&quot;But it is not just about affordable housing, it is the 3 billion or so that the government loses in revenue every year to support negative gearing. That would go a long way towards balancing the budget.&quot;<br /><br />No it wouldn't. Not in the medium to longer term anyway. When the rental shortage really bites, homeless people will demand Government build rental housing. This costs money, and lots of it.<br /><br />I'm not sure why you and so many others consider that the responsibility for building more houses falls to rental property investors. Rental property investors are looking for a good return. At the current time, this is not conducive to building new primary dwellings. Mind you granny flats are being built in considerable numbers right now (in Western Sydney at least) by property investors, due to their good return.</p>

They'd also be a bit too close to New Zealand which was just awarded the dubious honor by the OECD to occupy the bottom of the inequality index with Mexico which is said to be an impediment to growth. That is not to say that nothing should be implemented, but we need to be quite careful because future shocks from the financial world are set to develop after the US has just allowed the damaging pre 2008 structures again and gave them taxpayer backing.

	<p>I think you have misread that OECD report. It  was looking at historical growth and the impact of inequality. You are talking about going back to the 1980's. Currently, New Zealand and Australia are about equal on measures on inequality - although New Zealand is significantly ahead on relative income poverty and their inequality is decreasing, whereas in Australia it has been increasing. New Zealand is one of the few places where inequality s falling, and both sides of politics see inequality as a key issue.<br /></p>

	<p>The poor are getting richer. They have significantly less relative income poverty now than we do - they are sitting below 10%, we are about 15%. There is now doubt the reciprocal is true in Australia - the reason our inequality has been increasingly is because of increasing concentration of wealth amongst a few super wealthy individuals.<br /><br />Visit South Auckland though, and you will see poverty remains an issue, especially amongst the islander populations. This is probably one of the key differences between Australia and New Zealand - in New Zealand poverty is a city phenomenon, in Australia it is a rural problem and hence more out of site.</p>

	<p>Hewson also bandies about the use of the word reform which has now been bandied about by the media for every policy change or abolishment.<br /><br /> The dictionary meaning is 1. To improve by alteration, correction of error, or removal of defects; put into a better form or condition.<br /><br />Unless it benefits whole of society for the majority it can't be called reform!  So abolishing medicare (co-payments) is NOT health reform!!!! Allowing mining companies to tear every last mineral out of the ground and removing the tax to pay for it, is NOT Tax reform.  I just wish these politicians and media would stop bandying about the word reform, when it is NOT!  Vent over. ..... and one more thing Hewson....  Putting education back into the states hands, a 100 yr old antiquated system of government, IS NOT reform!  It is regression!!!!</p>

It was reformed all right, but not by him. It was only reformed by those with a vested interest in doing so. All Keating did was expose the ordinary folk to competition they couldn't possible compete with. Some Labor leader. And it begs the question, where was the union leadership at the time that allowed him to do it?<br /><br />In your eyes, Abbott and the Coalition are worse than Satan, but Keating was a hero.</p>

	<p>I don't think you understand the contention with &quot;get rid of the states&quot;. The Commonwealth derives its power and existence from the states. Think of Australia as 6 countries that decided to cooperate (federation), instead of 1 country with some lines drawn in. Abolish the states and the Commonwealth is abolished simultaneously.<br /><br />Local governments are the ones that should be abolished. Not only is it actually possible to do so, but they are the true homes of duplication and waste.</p>

	<p>Ah the age of entitlement, will it ever end for those already blessed.<br /><br />John is correct about one thing the need to restructure the Federation. An interesting note on that is under Labor an attempt was made to sort out local council's.<br /><br />The objective of the exercise was to give them specific responsibilities and a certain funding model which they alone would be responsible for. Abbott dumped the idea after years of work and now is making some sounds about working on the states restructuring. <br /><br />Brilliant ... no actually totally stupid. But then we are talking about &quot;Thought Bubble Tony&quot;.<br /><br />As long as he stays the PM any real attempt to restructure the<br />Federation will be held to political ransom.<br /><br />The very best thing the LNP could do is dump the dummy.<br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>The Federal government should take over administration of public hospitals from the States with would free up 40% of their expenditure for other areas, thus making GST changes unnecessary.<br /><br />Having the Feds administer everything else in health , but not hospitals is inefficient. Of course, some special grants to the States would need to be cut, but the States could make those up from savings on the hospital system.<br /><br />Thanks for some clear headed and unbiased reasoning John.

	<p>How much has this Government spent on defence, after alienating Russia and charging over to the other side of the World to the Middle East; and populist causes such as searching for a plane missing in a huge ocean, and interfering with Holland's arrangements for recovery of the downed plane over Ukraine?<br /><br />How much industry have we lost for a comparatively small subsidy?  How much industry have we lost through all the uncertainty over renewables and RETS?<br /><br />What a trainwreck!</p>

	<p>If there is a short fall in spending in this budget it is defense, despite the increase, 1.8% of GDP is still a disgrace. Even the commitment of 2% is grossly inadequate, this government needs to find $11 billion to get up to 2.5%. But how do you do that with the 660 billion dollar debt left by Labor.</p>

	<p>John<br />As is usual John, you suggest a plan that is sensible and structured, but unfortunately the plan means that people need to work together on that plan. That's just not the way, and you know that.<br />Opportunism is the name of the game and any possible point scoring and sniping will out-weigh sensible planning anytime.<br />It is un-imaginable that Mr.Shorten would ever embrace the plans of Mr.Hockey. It is equally un-imaginable that Mr.Abbott would possibly embrace a plan of Mr.Bowen. So once again, good planning is the casualty to Party politics and petty point scoring.<br />Maybe the sooner we become a socialist society where everybody loves every one else and no-one makes any money for fear of being critisized, the better.<br />Free everything is a plan - there we are, all join hands and make that work.</p>

	<p>Wrong Bill, it applies to working class people it is just that they don't earn enough to take advantage of the tax arrangements. How much tax do the working class people you refer to actually pay at the end of the day? Fact is some people try a lot harder than many others only to be told by people on forums like this that an ever increasing amount of what is theirs must be given to those who will not apply the same level of effort themselves, is that fair?<br />People can only work around the laws that are in place and it appears that neither side of politics, even the socialists will do nothing about supposed loopholes.</p>

	<p>A huge flaw in the, as always, reasoned argument from John.<br />In it there is criticism of the 'golden era' of Howard and Costello when errors were never made, money flowed to all and Australia was a bright and shiny place. The reality that this memory is pure fantasy will never, ever strike a chord with Abbott and co because they are in some strange trance like state where facts hold no import.<br />The Howard/Costello government sold everything that wasn't nailed down, including Australia's gold reserve for a bargain basement price and pork-barelled their way to election victories with middle and upper class welfare and tax cuts and in the process left a structural debt for governments to follow.<br />But you try and explain that to the rusted on conservatives and you will simply get the three word slogans about debt and deficit disaster left by Labor.<br />In any case asking for a medium to long term approach to Australia's economic woes from this government is a fantasy in itself - they think that 2020 is far to far away in the future to be worried about. In reality they are entirely focused on the next month or two and on who will be PM and on the front bench at the end of that time.</p>

	<p>Thank you cj22. Hockey also suggested that if Wayne Swan had been on the board of directors of a company he would have been sent to jail. This is the unhelpful and immature nonsense offered by Hockey in opposition and now he expects better for himself now the ball is in his court. The truth is that Australians at the last election were sick to death of the parliament of the previous three years, NOT JUST THE LABOR PARTY. Sadly our democratic process dictates that to clean out one group of politcians we must reward the other unworthy group of politicians. This means we are left with a two step process that drags on for six long years while the country goes down the drain. The Abbott crew sealed their fate as a government while they were in opposition. In other words the Abbott government were a means to an end of Labor. With Labor gone the means is longer justified and so Australians must wait three long years to finish the job. Maybe, just maybe we can then get a group of politicians in parliament that will offer a mature and constructive and co-operative commentary that will move Australia forward straight up the middle instead of the extremist right wing hacks we currently have no choice but to endure.</p>

	<p>The argument could be made that the howard government shouldn't have handed out tax cuts. While seemingly responsible when delivering successive surpluses, we could really use that revenue now. <br /><br />still, it was Labor that actually benefited from the two biggest years of the mining boom and still very quickly took us back into debt. Their response to the GFC was to greatly increase spending during a time of falling revenue. This was supposedly to protect us from recession, a recession we will no doubt encounter anyway as we try to pay back the biggest debt we've ever seen.  <br /><br />So Labor has risked a depression to supposedly protect us from recession. Now with the current debt, we are far worse placed should a second global shock occur. The Problem is not just the debt, but the rate at which the debt is increasing. We have industries now dependant on government spending. Switch that spending off and guess what? you risk recession.</p>

	<p>&quot;still, it was Labor that actually benefited from the two biggest years of the mining boom and still very quickly took us back into debt. Their response to the GFC was to greatly increase spending during a time of falling revenue.&quot;<br /><br />Do you not see the fault in your reasoning, it doesn't matter how that the mining boom was still going on at any relative size if the end result for the governments gross revenue is still shrinking because that still means they have less money to work with. As for explaining the need for a stimulus plan I will refer you to the explanation V gave you to one of your comments (the one where you wrote almost exactly the same thing as the quote above).<br /><br />&quot;So Labor has risked a depression to supposedly protect us from recession. Now with the current debt, we are far worse placed should a second global shock occur.&quot;<br /><br />Any sort of response including doing nothing would have led us to being in a worse position if another economic crisis or or financial bubble occurred, having two successive major economic crisis within a few years is enough to to risk a depression with even the best possible responses from the most fundamentally strong economy imaginable. It's not a matter of &quot; Labor has risked a depression to supposedly protect us from recession&quot; it's a matter of we dodged a bullet but most of the rest of the world didn't do nearly so well and are struggling to recover and because our economy is so tied into the rest of the worlds' economy that is having an impact. The Federal government (really all of the Australian economy) is too small to significantly affect that situation so you cannot blame the Australian government for the situation the world economy put the Australian economy into.<br /><br />&quot;This was supposedly to protect us from recession, a recession we will no doubt encounter anyway as we try to pay back the biggest debt we've ever seen.&quot;<br /><br />A) This is in no way anything close to the &quot;biggest debt we've ever seen&quot;, if you're going to state that I suggest to you go and look at the whole economic history of Australia (it's only 113 years, almost 114, but still not that long to review). During the 1920's years conservative governments (including the Country party aka National party) accrued between 40-60% of GDP of debt approximately 2 to 3 time the proportion it is today (see http://lowpollutionfuture.treasury.gov.au/documents/1496/pdf/01_debt.pdf page 8)<br />B) Even as high as our debt is compared to what it was before 2008 it is much much lower than most other developed countries and we there is no indication the country would have difficulty borrowing more if need be or paying back the debt we already have, I'm not advocating just to go on a spending spree because of that, but the definition of a debt problem is the inability to pay back debts or being unable to issue new debt.<br />C) It did protect us, but when the stimulus</p>

	<p>The end of my comment was cut off, oh well I thought it might be a tad too long.<br /><br />&quot;$300B is the biggest debt by far. As a percentage of GDP it was higher in the 20's however, Asutralia [sic] was a minnow then and our population went up by multiples in following decades. Would you advocate we do the same now?&quot;<br /><br />But because we are so much larger now our ability to pay that debt is also much higher, think of it like this, say you owe $100,000 and your household makes $80,000 a year, with other expenses and commitments it will takes quite some time to pay off  lets say 12 years, now change that annual income to $240,000 or a 3 times increase. Would it still take you 12 years to pay off? Probably not, because the debt to income ratio is completely different, it would probably take less than 4 years because you'd be able to pay it off faster and wouldn't have the cumulative effects of compound interest working against you. Absolute numbers mean nothing if you are looking at them numbers on their own, you need to look at their relative value compared to other absolutes and percent changes.<br /><br />I didn't say some one argued we should do nothing, but that was an option, I intended to cover all scenarios with that statement. It isn't too early to say we dodged the bullet see as the bullet was a recession in 2008 and/or 2009 and it is now the end of 2014, if the debt causes us significant trouble that would be a different metaphorical bullet, but I doubt it will.</p>

That's more than twice the amount roughly of what Howard got for selling telstra! What is the point of selling off our treasures and money earning enterprises to then have huge losses in the future?

	<p>Not that I am anything but appalled by the Liberals, but our alternative choices from the Political Menu are not something anyone but a drowning man would order.<br /><br />I often think Aesop's Fables should be compulsory reading.  I am reminded of The Miller, His Son and Their Donkey.  <br /><br />When things go gangbusters for mining, all of us ride on its back.  When mining is in the pits, we carry it.  <br /><br />What we need is 'good sense' not Economic Rationalism. <br /><br />Imagine if we divided the total sum of Economics by the total sum of The Invisible Hand of Nature (expressed in the same units) how close to zero the answer would be.  Our best science only views the world as through an advanced cataract lens.  Our least worthy claimant of the name knows almost nothing worth knowing at all.<br /><br />We need a 'good sense' economy.  All we really need to move towards it is to forget Economics and reclaim humanity and good sense.<br /><br />We are not alone in this.  Every economy in the world would be better served by good sense than by Economic Strictures.  <br /><br />We only have Economics-as-we-know-it so that we might be able to assemble the wherewithal that it costs to run huge Political Inanities.  However,huge Economics Economies and Political Inanities are past their use by date, if they ever truly had one.<br /><br />We have a collective set of social skills and it is these (together with the wisdom that is ingrained in us but that we have lost touch with) that will determine the 'right' size of our polities, and the nature of our most effective substitute for Politics.<br /><br />Right-sized polities will have right-sized economies, if we clear Economics out of the way.<br /><br />Once you realise that our 'conscious intelligence' is a very slight thing, in the early days of its development, that has misled man into Conceits he thought of as Reason, and that we have been equipped with a deep stock of good sense, a diversity of individual abilities, and a rich wisdom, abandoning Conceits (like Politics, Economics, much of Law as we know it) and the ways of living they promote becomes the much better path we can take.<br /><br />So yes - we can get away from the serial of Political/Economic Stupidities that debilitate us.<br /><br />Soon enough, events will demand we do so if we fail to take that set before the whole delusion of Reasoned Conceits falls in on us horribly.</p>

	<p>John Hewson demonstrates that the present government is unfit to govern. They have been unfit to govern since their days in opposition, when they demonstrated that they did not understand the dynamics of the Australian economy.<br /><br />As with everything else, the Coalition simplified the economy down to slogans and shouted them from the rooftops. Slogans replaced policy all through the last 6 years. Now the slogans are empty and useless, and the nation needs a policy rethink. Unfortunately the government is still sloganeering and blaming the previous government.<br /><br />Better economic managers? Bah, humbug! They couldn't manage a butchers' picnic.</p>

	<p>&quot;It should not be surprising that it doesn't add up or hang together.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I would suggest that they need to start with the overarching strategy. &quot;<br /><br />&quot;Suggest&quot;.  Absolutely this is what is needed. But I do not see it coming from an Abbott govt.  This is the Govt of small things.  The context is the fairytales that Abbott is a master at creating.<br /><br />Superannuation tax concessions are?grossly unfair and urgently need attention.  But that is too big a thing for this govt of small and mean things, most recently the cutting of the foreign aid budget.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>Mr Hewson has made some very telling points - paramount of course is that discussion of the problems facing the economy at the moment must be rise above party politics and ridiculous sound bite thought bubbles and election &quot;promises&quot; made during campaigns. If the problems can be addressed free of simple slogans this would be a big step forward as the economy is in no way simple and the slogans do it and all of us a vast disservice. Certainly we need greater attention paid to long term and necessarily slower acting reforms than are currently possible when everything hinges upon the dubious promises of the three year election cycle.</p>

	<p>Agree Malcolm that Mr Hewson made some very good points. <br />I can see that the dissatisfaction level with both major parties is building because of the they both manage to 'not deal' with issues. So there appears a choice - (a) bi-partisan agreement based on a fair approach, or (b) a new entrant to the market who will act in the best interests of the country and majority of electors.<br /><br />Both options require intelligent players to implement, but given the recent past history of the Laberal Party (Labor+Libs), I see option (b) more likely coming to fruition.<br /><br />Senator Xenophones new party NXT comes to mind. Although it might not ultimately reflect this evolution of the political landscape, it is a harbinger of change in ideas, and good for that.</p>

	<p>It was an arrogance on the part of the Govt to assume that they could expect Labor and the cross-benchers to pass policies that were totally at odds with what both Labor and the LNP had committed themselves to at the election.  <br /><br />Bad enough for the LNP to engage in an orgy of promise-making and promise-breaking.  No way should Labor be party to it.  The mess is one of the LNP's own making, by giving up major existing sources of revenue, by some pretty dodgy new expenditure, and by an unwillingness to tackle the high earner welfare that is a hangover from the final years of Howard.</p>

	<p>The solution is very simple. Amalgamate. Get rid of the states. Far fewer politicians, Streamline and cut waste between federal and state activities......<br /><br />The only people who don't want it are the state politicians, who will lose their jobs. We need to get the issue on the agenda.</p>

	<p>An interesting read Mr Hewson, and it is a pity you are not the treasurer.<br />However in relation to broadening the GST, I believe it should continue to exclude fresh fruit and vegetables and unprocessed food as it does now.<br />People should not have to pay more for eating healthy, and remember healthy people means less future strain on the health system.<br />You also forgot to mention the issue of negative gearing and cracking down on company tax avoidence.<br />And the most portant issue of all - <br />We need a federal ICAC so all the corupt politicians can be exposed.</p>

	<p>Agree mr fox that GST should not include food.<br />GST should not be raised. <br />If anything it should be lowered so as to stimulate the economy.<br />This would require that govt address the rentier attitude of banks simultaneously, as recommended by the Murray Financial System Inquiry last week.<br /><br />If govt was serious about revenues, for a start, it would look at how much it is wasting on super concessions ($40B), negative gearing for existing property and shares ($5B/yr).</p>

	<p>Two points for you to consider, dodo:<br /><br />1) I don't give a hoot what your private debt is. You incurred it, you owe it and you pay it. It doesn't affect my budget or my income one jot. But Government debt, be it State or Federal, does. I am compelled to pay for those obligations whether I like it or not. Therefore I am deeply concerned that Government debt has spiralled out of control and that I will personally have to suffer help to to bring it back under control;<br />2) Yes, you are correct to point out that the total Government debt is $653 billion. But always keep at the front of your mind that 75% of that total was accumulated by six years of actions by Wayne Swan. Some was inherited from the Howard years and some has been incurred under the Abbott Government.

	<p>hi john , <br /><br />let me try and diswage you from some of your misconceptions.<br /><br />one- as a private citizen, we have to earn our income first since we cant issue our own currency.  so any private debt  incured, we have to find the income first to pay it off.  this is a serious issue if your income falls or ceases altogether.<br /><br />two- the government issues the currency first and raises taxes later. thats how we get a deficit ex post fact. they do have operating accounts at the central bank where they try and maintain positive balances, but thats neither here or there.  the government imposes upon itself a set of arbitrary accounting rules which states that it has to issue treasury bonds(ie the government debt) in the primary  debt markets to a group of what they call market makers.  since the government is the currency issuer, its a risk free assett to hold for the private sector. no government in the western world with a sovereign currency and a floating exchange rate has ever bounced a cheque.   the debt is funded  through the cash flow a deficit creates in the economy.<br /><br />essentially the government is borrowing back its own money.<br /><br />the government actually doesnt have your money to spend.  ask yourself what happens when you pay your tax bill. both the governments tax assett, and your tax liability bothget destroyed.  taxes destroy currency deposits.<br /><br />so qualitatively  your or my private sector debt  is a  much more serious problem than the government debt.<br /><br />three - if we change the accounting rules , the government can spend(create deposits) without incuring any debt. it just creates the currency deposits in the banking system. it has been argued this is more inflationary, but the evidence  over the last 25 years in the western world, is that while public debts have gone up, and inflation has gone down.<br /><br />have a think about this.  total banking system debt is 2.5 trillion approx unhedged, and once we include hedging its down to somewhere between 2,2 and ,2.3 trillion.  the unhedged position of the banking system is somewhere between 200 and 300 billion.<br /><br />the government debt is 300 billion plus in oz dollars.   thats the output gap the government had to cover to maintain the umeployment rate at it current levels.<br /><br />to cover the output potential in the economy at a particulat equlibruim rate of employment, the government had to finance, since the banking system wasnt able to, and the end result is a 300 + biilion debt for the government.<br /><br />like i have said on this blog many times, the governments numbers never stacked up , the first penny to drop were the  dodgy valuations re net exprt figures, and the second penny to drop will be the banking system failure to expand its balance sheet to cover the contraction in the governments financial position, if the government keeps up this obsession with a surplus.<br /><br />they are already re writing the forecast</p>

	<p>John please remind us of why Labor had to borrow at all.<br />was it because of the $314 Billion dollars that the Howard government squandered between 2004 and 2007?<br />that was out of revenue received of $334 Billion and does not include the continuing cost of 2 wars that Mr. Howard took the nation into nor does it include the costs of leasing office space in buildings that the government once used to own as in the case of the DFAT building that the new owners wanted to increase the annual rent to over $27 Million dollars.<br />there are many more legacies that Howard left the nation during his terms first as treasurer then as prime minister.<br />Even his treasurer Peter Costello was left out of the decision to give tax cuts and middle class welfare.<br />Mr. Howard like Mr. Abbott didn't take good advice.</p>

Howard/Costello, built structural changes into the economy based on what they saw was a period of growing exports and favourable terms of trade.  That position has now reversed and neither side of politics is prepared to address the need to reverse the Howard/Costello changes.<br /><br />There needs to be an honest public debate to correct the structural imbalance in the budget but with the toxic nature of relations between the parties currently, it's not going to happen.

The one that afflicts Abbott's cognitive ability seems to be a problem with many Liberal supporters.<br /><br />&quot;The big spending commitments made by Howard and Costello are the fault of Wayne Swan.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The Rudd Gillard government spent like drunken sailors&quot; Dramatically overstated, and one only has to assume that you are referring to the GFC.<br /><br />It appears that Hockey is as good at predicting budget surpluses as Swan. But of course you would have an excuse for that.<br /><br />I have never heard a Labor politician attempting to pin a $300 bil. black hole onto Hockey, and I suspect you have not either. they have though accused him of increasing the deficit, which he has done.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>Let's have a look at some parallels here Joan.<br /><br />A big drop in revenue due to external influences.<br /><br />A promised surplus fails to eventuate.<br /><br />Debt and deficit go up.<br /><br />You seem to excuse the Coalition for all these things happening. That is fair enough as debt isn't as scary as it's made to sound and a drop in revenue is quite understandable... except that you (and the current government) refused to be remotely as reasonable when the exact same things happened to the previous Labor government.</p>

	<p>Without a credible explanation for allowing wealthier people to accumulate superannuation with greater concessions than those available to the majority of wage-earners.<br />All arguments about hard work, greater effort, or greater risk-taking by the higher earners need to be put aside.  They do these things for their own sake, usually depending on the much lower paid work of those who actually get their hands dirty.  <br />If it is achieved through honest work, there is no basis for objecting to the personal accumulation of wealth.  But there is a very sound basis for objecting to systems that allow higher earners to accumulate personal wealth through more generous concessions than those available to the workers and consumers who actually underpin the economy.</p>

	<p>Intelligent, concise and probably right. I have 2 comments:<br /><br />&quot;I would suggest that they need to start with the overarching strategy&quot;<br /><br />The only strategy the government had was to win the election. They have been winging it since then and I see no sign of this changing.<br /><br />&quot;We could also do away with a federal minister for education.&quot;<br /><br />This should read &quot;We could also do away with THE federal minister for education.&quot;<br /><br />Now THAT would be a win all round.</p>

	<p>A very wishy-washy commentary<br />At least Mr Hewson didn't moan about the lack of Carbon Tax and MRRT revenue as some populist commentators have been doing.<br />With coal and iron ore nearing or at cost of production prices those &quot;thought bubble &quot; taxes are unsustainable.<br />Mr Hewson did allude to Government duplication in education and some other areas, but does not grasp the nettle of too may layers of Government.<br />Neither does he spell out that it is the private sector that will compete against the world to make a living for Australia.<br />It is the Government's job to provide the environment and financial incentive that encourages hard work, determination, risk taking and invention.<br />It is also the Government's job to explain to everybody that lifestyle is out, your job is your life.<br />This is the only way Australia can expect to compete against the rest of the world for a living and be able to look after those of our own who need a hand.</p>

	<p>Agree, Johnno, &quot;lifestyle is out, your job is your life&quot;.<br />That phrase seems to encapsulate the Liberal agenda.<br />Aus labour is overpriced, thus the necessity for rapidly increasing the use of 457 visas.<br /><br />However, there is a cynical thought that keeps recurring and that is that the Liberals, and to a lesser degree the Labor, are not that into Australia. <br />Thus we get a firesale attitude and dubious Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).  <br />As noted by Senator Xenophone: <br />&quot;We are known overseas as the 'Free Trade Taliban' because of successive Australian government and bureaucrats having a fundamentalist, literalist approach to free trade ? something about which other countries laugh at us.&quot;<br />The more things change . . .</p>

	<p>Each and every one of John Hewson's suggestions made sense to me.<br /><br />It wold be nice of the current Liberal party would return back towards the political centre (rather than drifting further and further to the right) and take some advice from the likes of John Hewson and Malcolm Fraser. That is a Liberal party I could vote for - not the current ideologically driven, scientifically illiterate, &quot;poor people are bad&quot;, &quot;rich people are good&quot; simpletons feeding us fibs and 3 word slogans.</p>

	<p>Happy to oblige Freeman.<br /><br />First of all the lack of quotation marks from Olive and Monty indicate they are paraphrasing. With that in mind, let's examine your examples and see how they serve as &quot;twisted interpretation&quot;.<br /><br />The actual quote is &quot;utterly offensive&quot;. Mr Hockey made this bizarre and irrelevant complaint focusing on the aesthetic qualities of wind turbines while he and his party simultaneously spruiked coal (&quot;coal is good for humanity&quot; after all). This compares quite reasonably with &quot;Wind farms are unattractive, but coal is downright beautiful&quot;. The use of &quot;downright beautiful&quot; is an exaggeration, but follows the exact same logical process that Mr Hockey was following and therefore is not any sort of &quot;twisted interpretation&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;Women of calibre deserve PPL regardless of need.&quot; Well, &quot;women of calibre&quot; is a direct quote from Mr Abbott and the original plan was not to be means tested (which means &quot;regardless of need&quot;). Therefore... not a &quot;twisted interpretation&quot; but, in fact, an exact interpretation. It certainly serves as an example that illustrates Theos' point of the government being &quot;ideologically driven&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;Climate change is crap&quot;. More accurately Mr Abbott claimed the &quot;climate change argument is crap&quot;. Given the argument originates from scientific investigation and peer reviewed studies it would demonstrate scientific illiteracy to simply dismiss it as &quot;crap&quot;. Again, no twisting required.<br /><br />&quot;What schools really need is a chaplaincy program&quot;. That program, modified by Mr Abbott to exclusively employ only religious counsellors in state funded schools, is clearly another example of being &quot;ideologically driven&quot; which you asked Theos for. I'd be impressed if you could argue that the chaplaincy program wasn't ideologically driven.<br /><br />Back to you Freeman ;-)</p>

Well, it shows the government, after promising to government for all Australians, looks upon a significant number of people receiving assistance (a high enough number to mention anyway) as a burden on the rest of `us`..  <br /><br />An ideological and divisive comment intended to soften us up before cutting benefits to the lazy scumbags.<br /></p>

	<p>Monty<br /> Who says the 'leaners' are poor? Or that the poor are leaners'?  Leaners' are those that don't contribute. They can be middle class or rich. Thanks for illustrating my point. <br /><br />Chris L,<br /> what has Hockey's opinion on the asthetics of windfarms got to do with science?  You do realize that the praise of coal is around its ability to provide reliable base load power, which wind farms can't. Its a fact. Ask any scientist.<br /><br />If abbotts comment re PPl serves to prove that this government is ideologically driven, then what does that make ms gilliard, or any other government in history that offered an opinion.</p>

	<p>Theos, it almost seems like some kind of Newtonian Law of Nature comes into play when a politician leaves office.<br />Where previously their intelligence was wrapped in a thick ancient blanket of news-speak, hog-tied to Party ideology and strait-jacketed in personal ambition; going on a one-way walk-about from the Party Room releases the said politician into a field of action aligned with the better nature of the individual.<br />Some people have mused as to whether or not this phenomena falls into the category of Integral Politics.<br />I think it does. So good work Mr Hewson.</p>

	<p>Yes, blaming the previous government is something Kommandant Cormann has used as his mantra for far too long.  However, the Conservatives, those great money managers, have doubled the deficit. Now they blame a testy Senate.  In reality, if they dropped their plush 15-20 billion parental leave scheme and the extravagantly planned 20 billion Medical Research Fund (noting we already have the large National Health and Medical Research Council research scheme), then things would be a lot better.  The problems faced are largely of their own making and the fact that they seem determined to make this national a 'one trick pony', dependent on primary produce and mining exports - in the face of tumbling commodity prices.  Time to stop the blame game and come up with some new non-ideological policies.</p>

	<p>&quot;New non-ideological policies&quot;.<br /><br />I think we'll be waiting a long time for that to happen and it simply can't happen under Abbott.  The fool gave away the carbon tax, the mining tax and the superannuation tax (the one that was going to impose a tax on funds earning more than $100k p.a.).<br /><br />Simply put, with Australia running a structural deficit of its taxation revenue, the PM gave up the opportunity to recover these tax revenues without any political pain as to their introduction.  It beggars belief, doesn't it?<br /><br />But our Tony views all Labor initiatives as bad.  But that's our Tony for you,  nothing but ideology.  An idiot savant but without the savant.<br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>The only way this country will be able to move forward in a measured,long term and stable fashion is by real unbiased and fairly determined consensus.<br />The only way I can ever see that happening is by a real  unbiased muli party commision/commitee/panel,call it what you like,to be convened from some kind of summit with representitives selected from right across the spectrum of interests..industry,financial,unions,social services etc..along the lines,but much more inclusive and encompassing,as the Hawke/Keating union accord arrangements.<br />What this country needs is a five,ten or even twenty year road map that wont be detoured,hijacked or ideologically reinterpreted every three years.<br />However,Blind Freddy can see that there is zero chance of this happening with the current government of imposters whose political capital and trust is below zero and plummeting rapidly.<br />In short,nothing is going to progress until after the next election whenever and however that evolves.</p>

	<p>`the Government failed to provide an overarching narrative that could explain their budget strategy`<br /><br />On the contrary, if superannuation tax concessions are supposed to be justified by savings in aged pensions, yet they cost just as much, the less said the better.   If the GP Co-payment was needed to fix Labor`s debt crisis, yet the money was to be spent on the Abbott ego research fund, the less said the better.<br /><br />The more this government `explains its narrative` the worse the polls.<br /></p>

	<p>John, you have earned my respect as a &quot;frank and fearless&quot; commentator and analyst. It is so refreshing to have a big picture painted that starts with the facts and works towards the best interests of the people, with particular concern for the most vulnerable. Quarantining infrastructure from budget discussion would remove a huge distortion to the current discussion. What an opportunity wasted by Howard/Costello. Of your suggestions, I think restructuring the Federation arrangements is likely to be the most fraught - parochial politics is a deeply entrenched habit. <br /><br />I add two more major proposed reforms - the removal of political donations, paid access and special access of any kind, and the compulsory and effective teaching of civics, including the critical analysis of and effective participation in, the governance of our nation. Hopefully, that will lead to more discerning voting, giving us the politicians we need, not the win-at-all-costs scrappers we collectively currently wave into power.</p>

	<p>what Mr Hewson is proposing is the development of a policy and strategies for its implementation.  Sounds good to me.  Begin with a national conversation in plain language and then take it to an election.  Explain it clearly to the electorate, with reasoning that can be understood, and seek a mandate.  Should be quite simple really.  Unfortunately on past form vested interest will outweigh national interest on all sides.</p>

	<p>If John Hewson can come up with solutions for fixing the budget why cannot Joe Hockey? It's because he is caught up in ideology both of his own making and that of his political party.<br /><br />Hewson makes good points. Look at the graph of superannuation tax concessions and the total cost - $40 billion pa. It could be rejigged to offer a cut on normal tax rates of a couple of percent and save a huge amount. Look at the personal tax cuts initiated by John Howard in the 2007 election and endorsed by Rudd. They were never sustainable but now they are still talking about new cuts while at the same as fixing the budget. Stop it! It can't be done.<br /><br />Lets see today whether Hockey really wants to fix the budget or just cause more ideological pain.</p>

	<p>Thank you Dr Hewson for being that most rare type of former Liberal leader, forthright and honest. <br />The endless wave of tax cuts, middle class welfare and pork barrel spending of the Howard era were a blight on our economy that few on the right seem willing to acknowledge, even now. I admit that the Rudd and Gillard govts did nothing to repair the tax revenue issues, but the buck must stop with Howard.<br />The Abbott govt must now bite the bullet, and the hand that feeds them to reign in the $billions lost in tax breaks and super tax concessions for high income earners, they only help to perpetuate income inequality.</p>

	<p>Most on these pages believe the government is either over blowing the budget situation or taxing the wrong people. John Hewson like any ex leader thinks he knows better on just about everything.<br /><br />Now if I understand this correctly Labor believes the debt should be moved back for others to pay. No debt emergency they claim they would even like to stimulate by borrowing more.<br /><br />I think I will just stay debt free and watch.</p>

	<p>This analysis is pretty close to the mark.<br /><br />Just how many ex-Liberal leaders will do one thing while in power (benefit the rich) and then espouse another (be fair) when they leave the political spotlight?<br /><br />Apart from Howard who is yet to see the light, every living ex-Liberal leader is now critical of the current LNP approach, presumably because it's no longer in their personal interests.<br /><br />The carbon tax to direct Action change says it all really. Instead of taxing the top end of town for pollution, the LNP is going to pay them for it and then slug us when we go to the GP to pay them when our health gives way because of the pollution, a clever LNP gambit if ever there was one.</p>

	<p>Dean are you on something. The top end of town as you call them and I assume you are talking about the power companies (Mostly government owned by the way) were compensated under the carbon tax and they also passed it on down the line to you and me. Labor's 'real families' we're not required to pay anything for their pollution in fact they were compensated for it. So, those above Gillards 'real families' and below the power company owners footed the bill. The tax is gone, the power companies have not reduced their charges and the 'real families' get to keep their compensation so who won there?</p>

	<p>What the MYEFO will show is what we have known for years, the federal Government is spending $billions more than they recieve in revenue. <br /><br />We had a surplus of $23.6 billion in the 07-08 budget. From 08-09 we started the current trend of overspending which continues today. Since 07-08 revenues have grown approx. 23.1% whilst expenditure has increased approx. 47.7%. The problem is obvious and undeniable.<br /><br />A breakdown of budget expenditure during that time reveals &quot;General Public Services&quot; have increased from $16.6B pa to $33.6B pa - an increase of 102.4%.<br />&quot;Education&quot; has increased spending from $18.4B pa to $29.7B pa - an increase of 61.4%.<br />&quot;Health&quot; spending has increased from $44.4B pa to $64B pa - an increase of 44.1%.<br />&quot;Social Security and Welfare&quot; has increased from $97.8B pa to $140.6B pa - an increase of 43.3%.<br /><br />No doubt all these areas are well intentioned however unaffordable. As a nation we need to embrace the need to live within our means.</p>

	<p>Zaphod, <br /><br />What you're saying is that spending has increased. <br />What you're not saying is that the population has also increased. <br /><br />Generally, you'll find that government spending increases as the population increases. Often, this is compensated for by government revenue also increasing. <br /><br />That this isn't happening now is, as Hewson points out, because of a structural imbalance that took root under Howard, which has continued to grow ever since under the 'stewardship' of both parties.</p>

	<p>Where you attribute blame for the current problem is not relevant to the present. I did not refer to any political party in my comment, merely quoted real Budget outcomes released by the Government of the day. You may say that revenue increases have not kept up with spending increases and blame this on population, but this still denies the obvious, we are spending too much, or we are not raising enough revenue.<br /><br />Labor, and Mr Shorten, still deny there is a Budget problem and have no plan to reign in the spending.</p>

	<p>Zaphod, neither did I apportion blame beyond stating that the problem has &quot;continued to grow under the 'stewardship' of both parties.&quot;<br /><br />My point, though, is that it is meaningless to say that spending has increased if you leave out the fact that the population has also increased. Whether we are spending too much depends on the difference between the more that we are spending and the what that we are spending the more on. <br /><br />And given we are actually one of the lowest taxing countries in the OECD, there is an argument that says we are not spending too much, but collecting too little. <br /><br />As for your party political point, perhaps if the Coalition and its media partners hadn't been trash-talking the economy so relentlessly for the past 4 years, and draining consumer &amp; business confidence, then the economy might not be in the terrible shape it is now?<br /><br />Perhaps a case of if you wish for something badly enough, and for long enough, your wish might just come true?</p>

	<p>With due respect, the Australian population did not increase that much between 2007 and 2014. If the population was approx. 23 million in 2007 and was approx. 24 million in 2014 the increase would represent approx. 4% increase. This example obviously exaggerates the increase during that time so the percentage increase would be much less than 4%.<br /><br />Spending, however, did increase 47.7% during that time.</p>

	<p>Zaphod, are you taking inflation into account?<br /><br />Government spending will increase as the population increases, and it will increase also in line with inflation. <br /><br />As far as spending as a % of GDP goes, spending under Gillard and Rudd averaged less than spending under the Howard government. <br /><br />Government spending, and how we guage that spending, is actually far more complex than just comparing raw figures without context.</p>

	<p>Actually, the population of Australia has risen from 21.18 million at the end of 2007 to 23.72 million now.<br /><br />That's an increase of 12%, which makes your 4% guess not an exaggeration but the complete opposite.</p>

	<p>We did not blow some imaginary surplus. Peter Costello came out and made a 34 BILLION dollar bribe to return the Coalition! Kevin Rudd had to match that (and we got tax cuts for the next 5 years). Did I also mention that the World's Greatest Treasurer (TM) managed to miss out that we were already sliding into a total economic meltdown? Consider yourself lucky it wasn't Abbott and Hockey in charge when the GFC hit. We'd all be living under bridges and eating cold baked beans right now. Instead, we came out of it as one of the best performing economies on the planet.</p>

	<p>So we started from a position of Surplus in 07-08 and years prior. The record show this was the legacy of budget surpluses when a Coalition Govenment was in charge. Before 1996 Labor was in power and we had budget deficits. After 2007, Labor was again in power, and you guessed correctly, budget deficits again.<br /><br />Now you can offer all possible reasons, explanations and excuses for this current situation, but you cannot deny the simple facts of history.</p>

	<p>The only facts that are clear here is that the Treasurer put aside tens of billions of dollars to offer us a bribe to return his government. What did the next government have to do then? Give away those very tax bribes AND make good for all the infrastructure not built, all the schools not renovated, all the hospitals upgraded, all the roads and ports never made... all because Peter Costello wanted to go down as the 'Greatest'? And your excuse for that bad government is they made a surplus on paper?</p>

	<p>You've bought the overspending line which is a nice simplistic story.  When you start quoting % increases; context become important.  What was the % increase in population, GDP, and inflation during those years?  What was the effect of the GFC?<br /><br />What's happening now is similar to what happened to Labor - a drop in revenue.  It's called a structural deficit created by too many tax cuts.  The problem is not overspending it is not enough revenue.  Neither Labor or Liberal want to start this conversation because it implies fault with the tax cuts, 7 by Costello and 1 by Swann. It also implies the need for tax increases - taboo in the political sphere.<br /><br />If you really buy the overspending story - where would you cut?</p>

	<p>The Left needs to embrace capitalism more and the Right similarly needs to face up to any national government's responsibilities for adequate and effective social welfare. A private sector lead economy with a just and equitable public social welfare system are not mutually exclusive. Indeed there is a strong argument that they are necessarily complimentary. Promoting one of these and not the other is political game playing and not good government. Both sides of politics need to commit to this dual responsibility in the national interest. <br /><br />For the private sector to be most productive and maximise its profits it needs healthy, well educated workers. It is government's role to establish the conditions necessary for the private sector to flourish while also being socially responsible.   A government run universal health care and education system would achieve this. Health care needs to be free at point of access and education needs to be free at point of access through to tertiary level.<br /><br />While under-resourced health and education systems might appear to save the budget some expense in the short term, this will lead inevitably to higher costs in the broader economy further out, with more illness and unemployment draining the welfare budget and reduced productivity providing lower tax revenue.<br /><br />The key word to unite both a private economy with a just and fare public welfare system, is efficient. If both Left and Right could agree on 'efficient' there would be a lot less duplication and waste and a lot more healthier and better educated Australians contributing to a more highly productive and more profitable national economy.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>&quot;we could pass responsibility for all education to the states&quot;<br /><br />They already do!!!<br /><br />See; the Federal Government provides the education budget via Federal funding to the States, who then determine how they're going to spend the dosh they've been given.<br /><br />Universities - unlike the other schools; are funded directly by the Federal Government.<br /><br />Now; there's a National Curriculum, which is pretty much worked out by the Universities, that is used as the 'target' curriculum by all of the States when they work out their own individual curricula - and those individual State curricula influence the curricula that are offered within the Universities one finds in each State (given Universities are 'responsive' to local needs after all!!  Ha! Ha!).<br /><br />Once upon a time, I was the NSW TAFE representative on the curriculum development board for Art's Education NSW, so I've seen the system and how it works from the inside... and trust me; it's about as attractive an inside as that to be found within the lower colon.</p>

	<p>Thanks  John- one of the few saying it as it is; even to the point of confirming the problem goes back to the Howard years, thereby dispelling the myth of the LNP's good economic management credentials.<br />What John missed though was the debt trap set by global financial capitalism and the Howard debt driven economy which saw household debt treble.<br />I would say private debt is a bigger problem here and  globally than sovereign debt.<br />John failed to calculate how much productivity growth is required to pay off a $320 Trillion global debt.<br /><br />But full marks to him for again being one  of the few to suggest 'solutions&quot; to fix our budget- including  looking at super. The problem is the global economic and geo political challenges he referred to. I see a repeat of the 'engineered' 1973 oil crisis and what followed-including a unilateral interest rate increase by the US Federal Reserve.<br /><br />The Bank of America is predicting interest rate rises. With 56% of global GDP and 83% of global socks directly independent on zero interest it does not take much imagination to foresee the result. Just look at what happened to Japan after the US Fed. did the same thing and caused  the 'recession we had to have&quot;.<br /><br />US banks are flooded with QE money and multi nationals  with profits - it may not make one iota of difference what Hockey does- we are caught in the global washing machine but at least we can see it all for what it is and maybe really learn to 'protect our sovereign borders&quot; not so much from poor asylum seekers as from global financial capitalism/ corporatism.</p>

	<p>It is strange that our politicians are seen as removed from the general public, living in and playing out  their own exclusive perspectives,yet they don't accept that they are two sides of the same coin. Their financiers and corporate pressures brought to bear always detracting from their ability to govern for the people.<br /><br /> Bickering, point scoring and avoiding progress to win useless debate just  wont cut it anymore.<br /><br />John Hewson has actually talked about investment in Australia using bonds overseen by the govt.<br /><br />A return to the people investing in Australian industry with  public service oversight{management} and the security of government guarantee is a brave move with maybe just enough private input and pollie speak to avoid the great modern fear of government overseen[run] business.<br /><br />It is obvious that research and development requires tax payer[or bonds] funding and giving it to a multinational is just plain dumb.<br /><br />Congratulations John Hewson you may have less to lose but it was a brave and sensible suggestion.<br /><br /> Ahh and that  sounds like  knives being drawn and  sharpened with comments muttered like &quot;stuff your  future, this could impact on  my  political financial investment friends profit potential and hasten the  end of my political career&quot;.</p>

	<p>From the very outset I do not profess to be all that bright but one of the lessons learnt in my APS career was that you never rely of your higher duties allowance for your basic salary income.<br /><br />It seems to me that both the federal Government (and it matters not who is in power) and the most state governments have based the income on a type off HDA, the value of their mineral income at a much higher rate than they could reasonably expect.<br /><br />Both sets of political processes have based their income on a price in the order of $100 (guess) when it should have been on say the ten year average which might have been $75 less 20% and then worked on that for their income. <br /><br />Perhaps they are using the FIFO ecomonic logic which works the same way, I am earning $120K so by the ute, 4WD, get that tattoos and go to Bali, damn the construction phase has finished and now I have no job.<br /><br />It seems that a bit or prudence, a bit of conservative estimates (not related in anyway to the political variety) would have been in order. <br /><br />Also Hockey and his mates cannot now blame the previous governments ineptitude for their pickle, it is of their own development, like forgeting to cleanse a wound and expecting it to heal in short order!</p>

	<p>If we do have a budget crisis (and I am not sure that we do), then this is not the Government we need in charge to get us through the period. Hockey and Abbott are too divisive to create  the kind of national unity that we need to tackle problems.

	<p>At last a reasoned, well articulated proposal. I may disagree with some of the detail, but I strongly support the essence of it.  Such a pitty that those who actually make the real decisions can't offer something similar.  Given the current system (and those engaged in it), where the only objective is to do and say whatever it takes to get into power and stay there as long as possible, reasoned, articulate plans for the nations best interests are not even on their radar.  I remember Paul Keating claiming that politics was the noblest profession of all. Just a tragedy that politicians don't treat it as such.<br /></p>

	<p>While Mr Hewson is unquestionably correct about many of the issues he is addressing here, he also has form in relation to being able to sell good policy, in or out of Government.  Having thoroughly read the full version of Fightback and all suplimentary documents at the time, it was clearly the most comprehensive strategic pre-election policy I had ever come across.  Everything about Fightback would have been good for the country. Unfortunately, Mr Hewson's personal inability to translate his brilliant thinking into understandable and marketable concepts the electorate could engage with cost himself, the Liberal Party and, at the end of the day, the country very dearly. And, he lost &quot;the election that could not be lost&quot;.  Care must always be take that when criticizing others that one's past doesn't come back to haunt them.</p>

	<p>It is good that a person who  has been at the top table and is qualified to comment has come up with a plan.<br /><br />I am not qualified to plan, I am a mere individual from the masses. I do, however have an opinion and concerns.<br /><br />They are this, that there will be a very large number of people to be inserted into super departments, the infrastructure department at the top level and their salaries, will be huge. Those people don't come cheaply, and control over them will not be at the electorate level.<br /><br />Education will go back to the states and the national standard will be lost.  It will turn into a states distraction.<br /><br />I accept that the plan should be considered by the electors.</p>

	<p>Saline: It's an interesting issue being well qualified and therefore expectant of a large income, this  isn't a neat fit in a  public service sense. <br /><br />A modest income with excellent work conditions and work/life balance would be more conducive to a better outcome for all of us. <br /><br />Giving Queensland more control of it's  education is not a good idea, go up there and get a load of their concept of recycling and environmental management.

	<p>The good thing about the Hewson plan is that it will relieve the largely unqualified parliamentarians with personal ambitions from making national decisions which need to endure several lifetimes.<br /><br />The bad thing about the Hewson plan is that it doesn't include much democratic input. So we've got elected representatives, but what happens when the plans are roaring ahead and there is a government' such as the one of today, who doesn't have the confidence of the electorate early in their term?<br /><br />The cost is another matter, the man on the street has to own the whole project, business entities must remain at arms length.<br /><br />The plan has to be trimmed to fit into a democracy.

	<p>That idea to split the infrastructure spending off from the budget and handing it over to Infrastructure Australia is actually a pretty good idea, though I think the government should still finance some of the projects directly from any extra cash from the non-infrastructure budget, because many infrastructure projects have too low a rate of return for private investment too make sense but are still needed by the community. What I really like about this idea though is that it will show people what the government is borrowing money to fund.<br /><br />&quot;Of course, our political leaders would have rise above their simplistic political notions that &quot;all debt is bad&quot;&quot;<br />I'm have somewhat of a hard time believing this guy used to be the Liberal leader, because if that's true the liberal party's understanding economics (and the maths associated with it) have regressed a lot.</p>

	<p>The ATO calculates that in 2012/13 something like 41 BILLION dollars was sent overseas by the wealthiest Australians. This was hidden away to avoid paying tax. Based on that, it also means that EVERY SINGLE DAY, $110 million dollars leaves the country.<br /><br />For every $10 million dollars taken out of the economy, there is a loss to the government of $470,000 in tax that would have been collected. And there are a lot of multiples of 10 millions in 41 billion. So every one of those dollars taken out of this country is stuff not built, people not cared for, health comprimised and democracy undermined. In the end, we miss out on getting the best return on our tax dollars as we are making up the difference from our take home pay.<br /><br />Joe Hockey can't (or won't) do a damn thing about that. And John Howard didn't. They did ramp up the BS rhetoric about 'entitlement' and 'Team Australia' however. However, when the rich just get a free pass  every day entitlement is entrenched. Stop the rorts Mr Abbott!</p>

	<p>I just had a silly idea. Let all 'boat people' live and work here but charge them extra tax to pay for the privilege. If they have to pay back the cost of their 'care' in detention maybe this country may not be so attractive and we could save heaps by closing costly detention centres both here and overseas.<br />I am sure that most of the back door people could be proven worthy and productive members of society and only too happy to contribute to the cost of their care during detention. (how  I hate that word).<br />In the difficult times to come, many low lying islands will disappear due to rising sea levels, will see a dramatic rise in disposed persons, adding to victims of war. Regardless of the cause, this is already happening. I read a book recently about draining the Mediterranean Sea by building a dam, thus creating a new land, food for thought.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>The author is no doubt correct in all he has said however our present political system is not capable of implementing any such reforms. Lets just hope and pray that the next election delivers such a massive blow to both major parties (i.e. leaves both with just 10 or so members in the lower house) that political reform becomes an imperative. <br /></p>

	<p>There is a simple, but as Sir Humphrey would say, courageous solution to the national budget issue.<br />Restructure the economy so that it creates work (something it hasn't done for years.)<br />Two million unemployed or underemployed, with the full time job that more than 99% of them want, times average at least $10 000 income tax a year equals $20 Billion more income tax a year into the federal treasury. Problem solved.</p>

	<p>Thank you again John Hewson for highlighting the absurdity whereby via the superannuation rort gross inequality is being built into our society.<br /><br />This is not just the most obvious and easiest way to fix the budget woes but it is essential for our society that the rich get poorer and the poor get richer.<br /><br />I don't know why people find the lesson so hard to learn.  Ancient Sparta suffered a serious disaster from this communal disease in about 700 BC. Hundreds of years later Plato in &quot;The Republic&quot; (Book 8) declared that inequality in every place and every age has caused strife and war.<br /><br />The whole of Europe suffered from the upheavals from gross inequality in 18thC France.<br /><br />The Russian people are still reeling from the crazy inequalities in Czarist Russia.<br /> <br />All this idiocy of deliberately generating inequality does is to ensure that while some 2.5 people families live in houses with 5 bedrooms and seven toilets with an unused large boat tied up to their back yards, others who could be very productive with a little more money slowly come along hobbled by not enough capital.<br /><br />It is an economic system designed by idiots.<br /><br />If we can't bring ourselves to behave like the social animals we evolved to be, can't we just be rational?<br /></p>

	<p>Seeing as we're playing around today with plans and strategies to run this country's economy, it may be a good time to spare a thought or two on the personnel we're using and the failed structure we have in place for allocating them.<br /><br />For quite a while now I've been prepared to concede that Australia's governance model has passed its use-by date when viewed through the prism of functionality, but have been dismayed that any sort of discussion for change has been sold solely via reference to nationalism and symbolism. A &quot;republic debate&quot; devoid of these distractions and centred instead around operational concerns is, I contend, in need of commencement.<br /><br />By combining executive and legislature we put ourselves in the ridiculous situation where this country's financial matters are placed in the hands of someone with no more qualifications than an ability to win over a small, localised section of the population who would have voted that way anyway (I don't wish to make this a partisan rant, so let me say that in a parallel universe both Joe Hockey's goldfish and Wayne Swan's gerbil could just as easily have been treasurer if they stood - or swam - as their party's candidate in those electorates). This clearly is rubbish, and I'd suggest it's time for a major rethink on allocating responsibility for governance.<br /><br />By all means, if people want to elect some of the stuff that's drifting into parliament, let them. Why they should then be in the running for an important executive position is another matter all together.<br /><br />So how about this? Elect a President on a nation-wide vote for a fixed term. Allow that President to put forward candidates for important ministerial positions and have them voted on by the elected representative. Make the &quot;confirmation&quot; standards such that only those who can garner significant cross-chamber support get the gig. They are still elected - they are elected by the people we send from our individual electorates to represent us. Perhaps we can even consider re-badging ourselves as the United States of Australia. People who stand a chance of actually knowing something about their executive responsibilities get to do that, and Joe, Wayne, Joe's goldfish or Wayne's gerbil can get on with what they're good at - representing the local area that selected them.<br /><br />Plans and strategies such as those John Hewson discuss are all well and good. No plan or strategy, no matter how thoughtful, thrives on barren ground. If we could perhaps put the &quot;how&quot; on hold for a brief moment or two, and think through the &quot;who&quot;, we may be in with a chance.<br /><br />I look forward to the day when a &quot;republic debate&quot; has everything to do with getting rid of a stuffed-up governance system, and absolutely nothing to do with kings, queens, and &quot;coming of age&quot;.<br /><br />Angry responses welcome.</p>

	<p>&quot;Elect a President on a nation-wide vote for a fixed term. Allow that President to put forward candidates for important ministerial positions and have them voted on by the elected representative.&quot;<br /><br />Nah, I think we'd be best to wait a bit so that we can marry the best parts of being a Republic (our independence) with the administrative structures and stability that comes with the Monarchy. IMO, it's better to have the President elected by the Parliament and the Parliament elected by the people. And complete the circle by making the President one of the people.<br /><br />As for our governance, I hate it as well. However, the best antidote to that is the pressure that comes with scrutiny and it is coming down the pipeline in copious amounts. Leave the current administration in situ and pour the pressure on to clean it out of all the BS. Then we'll be left with a freer and more workable administration minus the freeloaders and ding-bats. No need to throw out the baby with the bathwater in other words.</p>

	<p>I respect your opinion Rob, but from my perspective I'm looking at any option which puts better people into the executive arm of governance. I'm no longer convinced drawing them from the legislature facilitates that, and for as far as I can see forward down the track I don't see any alteration in this state of affairs. That should be the starting point in any debate about what says and what goes - not the usual stuff the &quot;republic issue&quot; gets bogged down with.<br /><br />I also prefer to think of it in terms of a geriatric in a bath rather than a baby. The danger of having someone like Bronwyn Bishop overseeing it should, I hope, be fairly obvious.</p>

	<p>I sort of like it, but lets go a bit further. Don't elect the bods we need- press-gang them. Divest your conflicted assets. Obtain defined results within a set timeframe or you stay working for the government. Ideas from the parties shanghaied subjected to public scrutiny by citizen-based referendum so that they don't pander to special interests. Oh, and we'll need to actually educate the electorate a bit so that they can have an informed opinion.<br /><br />Hold on.

	<p>I went for hyperbole because that's what is being promoted as an alternative. The issue with democracy IS democracy. You get what you elect- good or bad.<br /><br />The primary issue here isn't the system- its the electorate. In the main its the uninformed, NIMBY, hand out seeking masses looking for bread and circuses that don't have an informed opinion on anything other than their Facebook accounts. No system that elects representatives to act on the behalf of the majority will work effectively until the majority actually gets off their fundament and familiarises themselves with the issues. Democracy gets you Republican numpties who actually vote against their own best interests because they've been engaged on fringe issues. <br /><br />You are wrong. There is nothing wrong with the system of government that we have. However, until we engage the electorate in a fashion that makes government 'we' instead of 'them', then Clemens will always be right, and we'll get the governments we deserve. The electorate is accountable for the system being the way it is. The way forward is to MAKE the electorate accountable. <br /><br />The executive used to utilise the advice of experts a lot more than they do now. Regardless of what people might think of the public service, it had genuine experts whose advice was frank and fearless and supported the best interests of the country. Howard undermined all of that with his decision to change the way secretaties were appointed. Now they are part of the game. Maybe a start point is to return the way Howard made things to the way they were...</p>

	<p>This is a significant day. I actually agree with what John Hewson says in this article. He isn't painting the Coalition as angels of the budget surplus nor Labor as the demons of the budget deficit. Clear and well written. Hopefully this will spur some informed debate on this issue.</p>

	<p>Thank you John Hewson for injecting some sanity into what has become a polarised and somewhat bitter debate. <br /><br />I can see that the Hewson approach is couched within the context of what might be achievable given the leadership available in Australian politics. <br /><br />The Treasury forecast are problematic because our economy is not controlled from within and global and multinational interests manipulate it in their own interests. Applying standard economic theory in this setting does not work, because we not longer have what is described as a classic market.<br /><br />The adherence to a poorly defined but highly restrictive conservative ideology as a basis for decision making has been shown to be highly flawed.  When it is deployed in the context of bitter partisan politics, the results are even worse.<br /><br />While Hewson is trying to be pragmatic,  I would like to offer a more radical direction, which I admit would be difficult to achieve, but which is more likely to achieve long term health for Australia and its citizens.<br /><br />First of all clearly define that the Australian economy is there to provide for the needs of the Australian people and not vice versa.<br /><br />Do away with the States and create a National government.<br /><br />Restructure local government to become regional government and elect a subset of regional councillors to form the National senate.<br /><br />Change the constitution to allow this to happen  and to clearly define National and regional taxation powers. Recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution as the First nation and provide rights for them to receive instruction in at least on indigenous language throughout primary school.<br /><br />Define the purpose of government more clearly to form a basis for uniform national law, develop a constitutional basis for generating and maintaining a population policy, <br /><br />Recognise that exponential economic growth as required by the current debt finance economic model is not viable into the future and develop a set of mutually agreed economic principles that take into account the declining need for a human workforce to generate an adequate GDP and ensure sustainable distribution of the GDP across the nation.<br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>&quot;Recognise that exponential economic growth as required by the current debt finance economic model is not viable into the future&quot;.<br />Journalists are letting us down by not asking fundamental questions. Why must there be growth? I'll tell you. It's called &quot;Fractional Reserve Banking&quot;. It requires continual growth and inflation to feed on.<br />It's more about wealth, prestige, reputation and privilege than it is about ideology.</p>

	<p>It would be useful if we brought back the pricing of carbon. Its the most efficient way of handling any action on Climate change and sending a price signal, rather than giving out money, which is a very inefficient system subject to rorts,through the direct action plan. That would help reduce the deficit and would be perfectly consistent with Liberal economic philosophy.</p>

	<p>Morrison for increasing revenue? It could have merit Don (he does seem to have a natural affinity for liquidity it needs be said), but it also requires proper packaging. Possibly launching &quot;Operation sovereign hoarders&quot; behind the slogan &quot;Start the floats&quot; may well be worth a try. Of course, this whole MYEFO malarkey would take a hit - no point in discussing operational matters after all.</p>

	<p>I am always wary of articles which try to appear balanced by blaming both sides of politics for whatever problem currently is presenting itself. Usually when this is done it is an article concerning a mess caused by the right of politics. If it is a problem that occurs when Labor is in power then most articles from the likes of John Hewson and other like minded right of centre authors sheet the blame home exclusively to Labor there is no hint of sharing the blame. In the current fiasco the blame should be squarely at the feet of the Liberal Party they are the ones who arrived in office without any real policies.<br />That aside Hewson has accurately described what our government should be doing given the parlous state our economy is in currently. The problem for this government the ground work should have been done while in Opposition they came to government without a clue just a few three word slogans now they find they might need a few substantial policies it's  a bit late the every day pressures of government will mean they are forced to keep coming up with half baked, patch work ideas which only make the problem worse.</p>

	<p>The truth is that all politicians come to their jobs with their own inidividual ideas, momentum and baggage. And they have to inherit the sum total of ALL the decisions made by their predecessors in business and Government. And they have to deal with whatever real-world problems they find themselves in whilst in the job.<br /><br />So, what they actually do in Government is a function of the intersection of all the forces that are in play.<br /><br />The take-out message? It doesn't really matter what advice you give them, they are going to do whatever they need to, to keep their heads above water at the time. And if they have any spare space in the cluttered agenda, they will squeeze in their ideologies as well.</p>

	<p>One of the issues Mr Hewson raises that I take a bit of umbrage with is that productivity must double. As Greg Jericho pointed out last week, measures defining worker productivity are on a steady increase. On the flip side, capital expenditure has become less effective as worker productivity rises.<br /><br />So- the national discussion on 'productivity' needs to take a different direction. It has to be about finding ways, both in the  public sector and private enterprise, to make capital expenditure more effective. A good step forwards would be for less bleating about workers having to work harder and a bit of analysis being done on why capital expenditure is becoming less effective.<br /><br />As a consequence, good policy might be to encourage behavior which enhances the effectiveness of capital expenditure, and penalizes ongoing failure. For example, if part of the problem is identified as effective project governance, then perhaps a way forward is to reduce the benefit of tax write-downs on capital investment for those companies who are contributing to declining productivity.<br /><br />Mechanisms which address the actual problem can readily be identified and the truth is that it would make EVERYONE happier- companies and investors would see more efficient outcomes from expenditure (bang for buck), workers would see national productivity rise, which would justify wage increases, and government would see higher income tax revenues. A win-win.<br /><br />But lets just wait and see what the IPA has to say about external forces driving the improvement of business, eh? I mean, the role of government is clearly to allow big business to spend money however they want, regardless of the idea of using legislation to make that expenditure be more efficient. Corporate Australia has RIGHTS, dammit! Even if that is the right to undermine national productivity and blame their workers for it.<br /><br />Is it too much to ask that the Productivity Commission- the highest-paid public servants in the country per classification- actually develop policy that will encourage business to fix their own houses before pointing at other edifices?</p>

	<p>The problem is that for such a program to be implemented would require a bipartisan approach and Abbott torpedoed any chance of this by his ruthless negativity and unconscionable tactics while in opposition. <br /><br />Abbott really did damage the national interest for the sake of his ambition.<br /><br />And now he expects everyone else to accept his excuses for breaking promise after promise after promise. He is a total hypocrite, as his shameless playing of the gender card over Credlin proves.<br /><br />A declining terms of trade is a valid excuse, in their minds, for their budget bungling, yet they condemned Swan for using the very same excuse.<br /><br />Abbott went in way too hard over so many issues while in opposition and has dug himself into a very deep hole. Climate change is just one case in point.<br /><br />The best way forward would be for the coalition to ditch Abbott and appoint a leader without so much baggage who could then win parliamentary support for a reform program in the national interest.<br /><br />Or stick with Abbott and we can get rid of the lot of these ideologically-driven, unfair underperformers at the next election.</p>

	<p>At last someone who was at the top of political life in Australia finally putting an end to the lie of the finest fiscal management in Australian history of the Howard/Costello years of high earner welfare that has dragged us to the edge of exchequer disaster. How about an admission of the lie of low inflation for nearly three decades; the use of the five billion a year of taxpayer speculation of negative gearing has pushed the cost of buying or renting a home to the disastrous highs of today, causing a great drain to the cost of living of Australian families; it's time to remove all speculation from Australian society that is damaging the lives of most Australians to the benefit of the few.</p>

	<p>Thank you Professor Hewson, for drawing attention to the bleeding obvious: &quot;origins of the current and prospective budget challenges go back to the Howard years ...&quot;. In effect you are declaring that the &quot;age of entitlement to tax cuts and tax perks is over&quot;. Hear, hear! But you could go further in addressing the problem of the average Australian's pattern of lifetime expenditure, which has to be changed to attain sustainability. Change towards more spent on preparation for working life (very broadly, child care, early childhood education, primary, secondary, etc), and more spent on preparation for post-working life (more on super, more on the taxes that fund pensions and later-life health care and aged care, etc).<br /><br />Of course, more spent on pre-working and post-working life means less spent on mid-life. Downsize your aspirations for a bigger mansion in a better suburb, and a bigger SUV, a gigantic telly, twice-yearly overseas holidays, etc, etc. Abandon your expectations of unsustainable tax cuts in every government budget, federal or state. Looking at the Howard-Costello-Abbott-Hockey-Corman perspective, there is a crisis in their lack of ideas on how to deal with downsizing of mid-life aspirations. We went too far, too short term materialistic, in lifting living standards for mid-life, and that is now costing us dearly in the impact upon pre-working and post-working life stages. Maybe it's time to proclaim the recession we have to have, a recession in our personal spending rather than a recession in our societal (government) spending.</p>

	<p>A good (almost) party-free analysis from you John. Just missing a few salient points.<br />1. Kevin Rudd also delivered tax cuts in his first budget. <br />2. Why oh why, if the economy is in such dire straits, did Tony Abbott &amp; co. scrap the Carbon Tax &amp; Mining Tax? Billions of dollars of income gone.<br />3. Why did Tony Abbott start handing out billions to polluters not to pollute (Direct Action)?<br />4. Why did Tonny Abbot reverse Kevin Rudd desicion to abolish Negative Gearing? <br />The reason the budget was &amp; is a disaster was because it is seen as giving money to the big end of town &amp; penalising those who can least afford. <br />The main reason that Tony Abbott got elected was because Kevin Rudd &amp; Julia Gillard were less popular than he was at the time.<br /></p>

	<p>I don't know how he has come up with his numbers.  But a good way to think of who is affected is by looking at how each taxpayer &quot;benefits&quot; from the concessions.   This means looking at the difference between what the net result is with and without super.<br /><br />For the person on $20,000 this means looking at the tax bill with the $1,900 contributed to super and the same amount assuming it were taken as &quot;pay&quot;.  In the first case with the low income tax offset the tax bill is $285 (I.e. $0 income plus $285 super).  If the whole amount ($21,900) were received as pay then the tax bill would be $258.  In this case it &quot;costs&quot; the low income earner $27 to contribute to super.   The &quot;high&quot; income earner gets the benefit because the super tax rate is significantly less than their marginal tax rate.<br /><br />One of the problems with super is that all sorts of distortions take place because of rebates and other &quot;adjustments&quot;.   And unfortunately this introduces complexities which someone on a low income is unlikely to grasp.   (It should be noted that my figures ignore the medicare levy and other &quot;concessions&quot; of which I am unaware that may apply to super contributions by low income earners.)</p>

	<p>Thanks, I don't think the figures make sense mu quick look at it shows:<br /><br />To generate $100 in both parties super account assuming the &quot;tax concession&quot; is a benefit (which is questionable as super locks money away for a long time to reduce the government?s future liability and must be compensated for):<br /><br />I assume the $118 is simply that required when taxed at 15% (actually = $117.65 required).<br /><br />Someone on $250,000 top rate, including medicare is 47%, concession of 32%. To generate $100 requires $85.47 (tax conc. $27.35)<br /><br />Some on $20,000 top rate, with medicare exemption is 19%, concession of 4%, to generate $100 requires $112.36 (tax conc. $4.49)<br /><br />Pretty meaningless as you say as there are so many other input/outputs that must be considered eg: What is the benefit of someone not requiring any government support in retirement and should there be some concession to get as many people into that category as possible? Does the concession outweigh the benefit cost. Simplistic views say just rip more out of the wealthy and don't worry about the future.<br /></p>

	<p>Slothskin,<br /><br />I think I must have been having a bit of an off day yesterday.   I can see what his figures mean now.<br /><br />As you say the $118 comes from the gross taxable amount that needs to be contributed to super to end up with a net $100.   Assuming the amount is &quot;salary sacrificed&quot; this is the amount the low income earner loses out of their gross pay.   But this person doesn't have a liability to pay income tax.   This means that the pre tax and post tax amounts are the same.  In effect the low income earner has to pay $118 out of their pocket to get the $100 in super.<br /><br />With the high income earner $118 also needs to be &quot;salary sacrificed&quot; to get the $100.  With this group, however their marginal tax rate is 47% which means the &quot;loss&quot; of after tax income is $118*(1-0.47) = 62.54 (which is close enough).   This means that the high income earner has to &quot;give up&quot; about $62.50 in after tax pay to get $100 in super.<br /><br />I think that if numbers like this are going to be mentioned they really should be explained in more detail so we can see where they come from.   Often it comes across as a &quot;trust me&quot; presentation, which always makes me wary.</p>

	<p>Calculation as follows&quot;<br /><br />Tax on $20,000 = (20,000-18,200)*0.19 =342 Less LITO 342 gives 0.   Only tax payable on super $1,900*0.15  = 285 <br /><br />Tax on $21,900 = (21,900-18,200)*0.19 = 703 Less LITO of 445 = 258.  No super tax payable as no contribution.<br /><br />I think the ATO tax calculator ignores the Low Income Tax Offset (LITO) which is a non refundable amount of $445 until $37,00 at which point it starts to reduce.<br /><br />The $27 is the difference between the 285 and 258.<br /><br />As I said before there are a great deal of complications that arise because there are all sorts of other tax offsets and concessions that apply according to family situation so I agree that the article's numbers are pretty meaningless without explaination of how they have been derived.<br /><br />At the end of the day superannuation is structured in such a way nowadays to be a great benefit to the wealthy.  The original design was better in that it only provided a tax deferral mechanism (which was valuable) but fairer.   The problem with this whole area is its complexity and to understand it you either have to be bright and have a reasonable amoun of time or rich and be able to pay for advice!</p>

	<p>I think John meant someone below the tax free threshold when he said $20,000. Someone on $20k a year to get $100 in their super account would indeed have to sacrifice $118 but would pay $22 less tax so the $100 would cost $96.<br /><br />Whereas for someone on $18,000 to end up with $100 in their super account it would indeed cost $118.</p>

	<p>&quot;...commit to a 10-year target to double national productivity, and then seek to pull together the economic, industry and social policy reforms that will be required to get there.&quot;<br /><br />Thank God John Hewson isn't LNP leader anymore!!<br /><br />The only thing needing committal after a suggestion like the one of his that I've quoted above, is his own!!<br /><br />&quot;Double national productivity&quot;!! At a time when the number of jobs is being reduced left right and center!!  What sort of limbo has John been living in?!!<br /><br />As it is, Australian employees are being expected to undertake the work that their former colleagues undertook; with many of them being moved from full-time to part-time positions while being asked to undertake work tasks a former employee used to do...<br /><br />And here's John asking for &quot;productivity to be doubled&quot;!! <br /><br />I'm wondering what sort of 'incentive/s' he's considering in order to obtain such a mind boggling increase in national productivity...  Punitive ones?  The lash and overseers brought back perhaps?!   <br /><br />&quot;No meal for you slave - err employee for not doing the work that would have been formerly done by four or five just to receive a handful of rice!  You ingrate!!!&quot; is the kind of thing that more and more Australians can expect to hear if the LNP's more usual punitive approach is followed in attempting to extract a doubling of national productivity!!<br /><br />Or perhaps the usual bollocks incentive/s of &quot;sharing in the wonders that a doubling of one's labour will bring, through the trickle down effect&quot;!! <br /><br />The proof is there for all to see of just how much investment Australian corporations have re-invested back into the economy of the Nation that they urinate upon.  They whinge, they cry, they pay millions on advertising campaigns that con those who should know better into self-sabotage and they cut jobs while &quot;off-shoring&quot;, rather than show pride in the fact that Australian workers aren't paid or treated like workers elsewhere!!<br /><br />The symbolic urination from on high that Australia's corporations engage in, is the only 'trickle down' effect the ordinary Australian is likely to see until there's some guts and backbone shown by our political leaders.<br /><br />Forget not my fellow Australians John Howard's rallying cry of &quot;Aussie hard workers deserve to receive the fruits of their labours&quot;... and take a look at what you've reaped!!!</p>

	<p>Given what I've seen of economists in my life to date - the most current and senior one being a professor of economics who advised Whitlam; I am more inclined Harquebus, to believe that despite knowing and understanding the exponential function and the physical consequences of relentless compound growth, many economists - especially the conservative academic ones, are more akin to the mad alchemist/necromancer/wizard who despite knowing the consequences of the spell they cast or the potion they concoct, become obsessed with their own ability to control the whirlwind they're unleashing...<br /><br />Their vision becomes a living entity to them, rather than a set of actions that will inevitably lead to a whole raft of unknowable outcomes that despite the rudder they believe they've firmly attached to the stern to steer by, is inevitably tossed about like a directionless cork tossed on a powerful stream of events that are way beyond any living being's ability to predict, let alone control.<br /><br />They delude themselves into believing that not only do they have the prescription to something that they believe needs to be cured, but that they have such control over the purported cure, that there's no possibility of nasty side effects...<br /><br />Ah; if only that were the case!!  We'd have no need for any more economists - or doctors...</p>

	<p>Affordability of disability pensions, aged care, education etc. should invite a question too rarely asked - given the obvious wealth of our society, why this portrayal of every social welfare cost as being ruinous? Big Business or wealthy working rent-seeker subsidies are also costs but are in contrast never described in that fashion. <br /><br />Controlled as they are by transnational capitalism, (often property-owning) politicians of contemporary governments demonstrate a total disinterest in providing a good range of social services (health, education, social welfare, aged care, etc.) of acceptable quality for ordinary people. <br /><br />Mainstream media demonstrates a great commitment to the ruling class strategy, by self-censorship and by reluctance to provide space for differing views. That is easily proven. 27% unemployment is infinitely more damaging to society than a 27% fall in the stock market casino, yet the latter would command infinitely more media attention precisely because it affects the class interests of those who control the mass media. In the vast library of expositions on the Eurozone crises, most notably, the focus is entirely financial; the unemployed, marginalised and ill are rarely worthy even of mention.<br /><br />There is also a deliberate refusal to recognise that increasing income inequality was the proximate cause of the Great Recession. <br /><br />We could, for instance, actually afford a 24-hour working week with 38-hour pay were Australia's own income inequality to be reversed.<br /></p>

	<p>Thank you John for what is at least a reasoned debate even if I can not agree with all that you have said.  It is much better than what we have had from this government.  <br /><br />All of the points that you have mentioned are relevant as well as many you have not mentioned.  Superannuation as it is now set up is a Robbin Hood tax in reverse where it is giving the bulk of the tax concession to the most well off in this country.  It does little in its current form in reducing the future cost of the aged pension.  And has only added another ever increasing cost to the budget.<br /><br />Business tax concessions and loopholes are like a cancer on the budget that this government has done little to fix.  If these concessions and loopholes were closed off there is every chance the overall business/corporate tax rate could be reduced.  But until we do that we will never know.<br /><br />Business/corporate tax concessions and loopholes are not just a cancer on the budget.  The are also a cancer on competitive behaviour in this country.  Those businesses, especially multinationals, who can use to these tax concessions and loopholes to pay very little if any tax have an uncompetitive advantage over other companies which harms our economy.<br /><br />Yet what have this government done.  They have imposed the inequity of their budget on the most disadvantaged and call that a solution to the budget problems.  They have cut government services, many that are important in enabling people to get jobs and businesses investing back into their business and into the economy/  And they call that a solution to the budget problems.<br /><br />We talk about improving productivity.  But investment in education and skills development along with health are very much an investment in productivity.  And what have they done but cut such investment.  <br /><br />The problem is John we have people in government who have no idea of the role of government let alone investing in the economy and productivity.</p>

	<p>While John Hewson and others point to structural deficit0 as the main reason  -such as tax cuts, super, business incentives, removal of the carbon  and mining taxes as well as 'security&quot;  expenditures clown Hockey blames the terms of trade and claims  no one saw this coming.<br /><br />Well a prudent treasurer would have- as he/she should have seen the 2007/8 GFC coming.<br />Fact is the terms of trade are still above trend. Neither that nor the Senate are responsible for the mess Hockey find himself in. <br />The man who lambasted the Labor Government for claiming part  of the problem a reduction in receipts is now claiming the same thing=after HE reduced receipts even further and increased expenditure with the Iraq adventure- direct action and other dumb policies.  <br /></p>

	<p>There's nothing new in this and much is pie in the sky:<br /><br />' I would suggest that they need to start with the overarching strategy. Say, commit to a 10-year target to double national productivity, and then seek to pull together the economic, industry and social policy reforms that will be required to get there.' Wow. I assume the LNP is the 'they' in this narrative and Bill 'Dr No' Shorten will be complicit all the way.<br /><br />And another:<br />'a realistic restructuring of our Federation should see substantial expenditure savings by eliminating duplication between the Commonwealth and the states... This will call for a decisive shift in the allocation of responsibilities, and a willingness to scale down, if not close, departments at one level of government.' Nice try John, forget the redundant public servants, what will be do with all those redundant politicians that have to agree to the scheme?<br /><br />Superannuation.<br />John forgets to mention that those 'at the top' who enjoy 'obscene benefits' also pay around 70% of the personal income tax take - to whom? The Salvos? Maybe they deserve a tax break to save some money. I case no-one noticed, those that retire with large superannuation funds are excluded from the pension through means-testing. The fix here is to limit lump sum payouts, not to engage in yet another 'envy of the rich' exercise. <br /><br />Infrastructure Bonds<br />Another tired 'idea' except that John wants 'an attractive coupon rate', which means taxpayers must pay an interest rate subsidy for debt the Commonwealth can raise anyway. <br /><br />I could go on, but Hewson's proposals are minor beer in the context of the savings task ahead. The great land of Oz has had a wonderful party for nigh on 20 years living off a large quarry and great beaches - it's over. Spending will have to be cut, regardless of the party in power, and those most dependent on the spending will hurt the most. Such is life. <br /><br /></p>

	<p>Just a reminder of the PM and his Treasurer's views<br /><br />Was that a Budget surplus in your first year, you say?<br />Post Budget Address, National Press Club: Joe Hockey May 2012 (available on you tube)<br /><br />and this gem from Tony in his Post Budget reply 2013 (available on liberal.org)<br /><br />&quot;Last year, the Treasurer began his budget speech declaring, and I quote: ?the four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement of the?success of our policies?.<br /><br />Well, surpluses would have been a vindication.<br /><br />But there are no surpluses.<br /><br />Not this year.<br /><br />Not next year.<br /><br />Not the year after that.<br /><br />The Treasurer now says that there will be a surplus in four years? time.<br /><br />That?s four years after the Treasurer and the Prime Minister said that it had already actually been delivered and spent tens of thousands of your dollars boasting about it in letters to their constituents.<br /><br />If a public company made these sorts of claims its directors would most likely face serious charges rather than asking to be re-elected.<br /><br />If this had been the only dodgie promise, they might have got away with it but this government never gets it right.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Should the Coalition win the election, there will be no nasty surprises and there?ll be no lame excuses.&quot;<br /><br />No surprises and no excuses.<br /><br />Thanks for the clarity Tony.

	<p>If we are serious about reforming the constitutional arrangements for the Australian Federation we need to acknowledge certain facts. Generally the resource rich, northern states of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and to some extent South Australia, are on a different and convergent economic path. The priorities of Victoria and NSW in terms of the economic cycle is out of step with the Northern Region. Currently prosperity flows away from the North to the Southern States, partly because so many enterprises have head quarters and the banks are centred on Sydney and Melbourne. The Northern Region which is more decentralised, in fact, would develop faster if it could set its own economic agenda. The next 50 years will see the rise of prosperity from resources in the North, as apposed to the traditional powerhouse of the Sydney Melbourne axis. Queensland would be better off seeking independence from the Federation accept for matters of defence. As for major procurements for defence, has there been anything but debarcles in fighter aircraft or submarines? If we need to reform our constitution many in the North favour either a looser federation, or allowing the North to break away.</p>
