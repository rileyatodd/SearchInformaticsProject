This proposition involves a lack of self-reflection that is breathtaking even for Tony Abbott. And in essentially accusing his colleagues of sexism, he may have made a career-limiting move."/>

  <p><strong><em>Tony Abbott's defence of Peta Credlin against what he says are sexist attacks from his own MPs shows a breathtaking lack of self-reflection, writes Paula Matthewson.</em></strong></p><p>In the political style the Prime Minister has managed to make his own - namely tumbling from frying pan to fire - Tony Abbott has exacerbated the hostilities simmering between his chief of staff and colleagues by accusing the MPs of sexism.</p><p>In doing so, he may have made a career-limiting move.</p><p>In the face of ongoing criticism about the operational style of his most senior adviser, Peta Credlin, Abbott made the extraordinary suggestion today that she would not be "under this kind of criticism if her name was P-E-T-E-R as opposed to P-E-T-A", and that "people need to take a long, hard look at themselves with some of these criticisms".</p><p>This proposition involves a lack of self-reflection that is breathtaking even for Abbott.</p><p>Not that long ago, certainly within the memory of most voters, Abbott accused the then prime minister Julia Gillard of playing the gender card when she suggested some of the criticisms levelled against her were due to sexism. Abbott denied there was any inherent sexism in the community, stressing that any and all criticisms of Gillard were based on her competency and not her gender.</p><p>By this logic, Abbott has placed himself between the rock that is Credlin's incompetency and the hard place that is a sexist parliamentary wing. That's sure to go down well in the party room.</p><p>Ambitious backbenchers and sidelined ministers have grumbled to the media for months about Credlin's centralised micromanagement style. This has flared into several spot fires over past weeks as opinion polls continue to look dire for the Coalition and ministers angling for promotion (or simply to save their skin) have ratcheted up the blame game.</p><p>To an extent, such behaviour is par for the course. It's the chief of staff's job to support and protect the Prime Minister, and being the gatekeeper necessarily involves being the flak-catcher too. Credlin is not the first or last PM's chief of staff to be met with resistance or agitation from the parliamentary wing.</p><p>But concerns expressed about Credlin have flared dangerously beyond what is the norm, evidenced by the astonishing story published earlier this week suggesting the Liberals' most senior elected woman, the Foreign Minister and Deputy Leader Julie Bishop, is at loggerheads with the adviser and unwilling to continue "taking orders" from her.</p><p>This revelation comes after weeks (and, in some cases, months) of claims from conservative columnists and commentators, as well as journalists with strong Liberal or business connections, that no advice is getting to the PM other than that permitted by Credlin. Former PM John Howard and the Liberals' campaign strategist Mark Textor have even taken to the airwaves in apparent attempts to get through.</p><p>And now to dismiss these criticisms as mere sexism, and therefore without foundation, Abbott is essentially pulling down the shutters.</p><p>Former Howard government minister Peter Reith is reported to have cautioned against this, saying it was "a bit of a mistake on Tony's part to throw in the gender claim", and that Abbott "would be wise to put to the side gender issues and focus on genuine concerns and worries people have had, generally on the backbench but also some ministers".</p><p>On this occasion Reith is absolutely right. This is anything but a wise move for a party leader to do when his MPs are feeling demoralised and pessimistic about their future electoral prospects.</p><p>Abbott has rightly noted that Coalition MPs would be disinclined to change prime ministers mid-stream in light of the voter wrath brought down on Labor for doing the same. But Abbott ignores the fact that he is more unpopular than Rudd was at the time of being deposed, and by refusing to countenance any suggestion that Credlin is either incompetent, or just not managing the role effectively, Abbott is inviting dissenters to conclude that the only way to get rid of Credlin is to get rid of him.</p><p>Ultimately, the Prime Minister is responsible for the staff appointed to his office and the advice he decides to accept and act upon. By deflecting criticisms of Credlin, which are in fact de facto criticisms of him, and calling his own people sexist, Abbott is causing himself an almighty problem – he's disregarding and provoking the very people who can remove him (and Credlin) from the Prime Minister's office.</p><p><em>Paula Matthewson is a freelance communications adviser and corporate writer.

	<p>Wow what a hypocrite. <br /><br />The criticism I've read of Credlin was by LNP complaining that they couldn't get in contact with Abbott. So is he saying that the LNP are sexist? <br /><br />Surely it wouldn't matter to anyone else if she was acting as blockage to his inner office.<br /><br />I personally don't give a cricket bat one way or the other about Credlin. Its Abbott that is the problem.<br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>Once again Abbott's own words are thrown back at him - perhaps it is not a case of having it in writing but examining the political context in which a statement is made. This would then allow us to say that his attack on Gillard's remarks about sexism was correct because he said that in the context of the parliament, while the attacks on Ms Credlin are bad because these have said away from the context of the parliament. It has a certain kind of Abbottian logic too it, even if that is unclear to most of us.<br /><br />My issue with Ms Credlin is, if she is acting as a filter, that she is not an elected office holder so it is not up to her to dictate what are essentially matters that derive from Abbott holding an elective office both in his party and in the parliament. Also she is not a public servant in the true sense because she is essentially a Liberal Party appointment as the PM's CoS. Either way I do not see it as her role to filter and thereby determine what is important to the nation and to the PM. <br /><br />I have no quarrel with her as an office manager making sure the day-to-day running is smoothly done but straying into a political role that really belongs to an elected official who can be removed from the job at an election as is right is a step too far. The last time I looked, the PM's appointed by a ballot of elected party members if that party holds a majority of seats either by election or by negotiation. Therefore it is important for the PM to be accessible to those who have elected them - not have those people' access impeded according to the private political views of the CoS if that is indeed what is happening.<br /><br />If she wants political input then she should seek election. And I might add I hold the same concerns regarding any PM's CoS - regardless of the party.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately the way the system runs now is that<br /><br />1 The advice of the public service is ignored and or not passed to the minister /PM<br /><br />2 The political staffers with no expertise in the subject make sure the Minister / PM never hear anything that it would be best he should not know and generate a spin approach and policy on the run.  This way when things go pear shaped, the spin doctor gets it in the neck. (You Know like Howard not knowing about Tampa)<br />3 the Minister are given policy briefs and speaking points ( Three word slogans) and if they have shown any recalcitrance are badgered by the Chief of Staff.<br /><br />The Chief of staff works out the political strategy, taking into account the &quot;idiots&quot; he or she is dealing with as elected members and pick and choose and shift the &quot;narrative&quot;.<br /><br />We thus have poll sensitive policy making with no expertise, no accountability and no stability.<br /><br />Don't blame Peta, Rudd had the same system and his Chief advisor got the same flack.<br /><br />For once I agree with Paula.  Keep away from any Chief spin doctor, after all they are a special piece of disposable collateral.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>Alister Jordan is the name you are missing.

Alister in now high up the Coles tree , if Pete gets to be an MP she will have to deal with the PM's Chief of staff.  Ouch!!</p>

	<p>Every time I've seen Abbott talk longer 2mins he's put his foot in his mouth.  My only complaint with Ms Credlin is she hasn't done enough filtering.<br /><br />Any good Office Manager should be able to step into their bosses chair in their absence &amp; carry on business in the manner their boss would want.  The problem at the moment is every week what Mr A wants changes because neither the public, the Senate or his own back benchers want the same and his position is looking weaker.  Ms Credlin is no mind reader for his momentary position on topics.<br /><br />If Mr A wants to sure up his position a good start would be to go back to the policies he was elected on &amp; put Hockey &amp; his budget where it should have gone in the first place (you can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear).</p>

	<p>K Rudds deposition was not well explained to the electorate. No problems with that here as Pe-tony have more than explained why they should be removed to the electorate and their not even half way through their first term. <br /><br />I think a change of leader would be the opposite of what happened in K Rudds case. It would give LNP a huge boost rather voter dissatisfaction at the change. But shhh? don't tell them that.

	<p>Think more broadly Yank.  The salient issue is just that conservative thinking is rapidly being seen as no longer relevant to the situation facing the world.  It?s worth dwelling on how we came to be where we are.<br /><br />Since the 1970s people in democracies have become less and less engaged with political parties.   This is the root cause of why politics makes mistakes like amalgamations.<br /><br />Disengagement made parties less representative and less internally regulated making it easier for factions and very wealthy individuals to dominate politics.<br /><br />Ordinary people also became wealthier making them less unified about fairness<br /><br />Advertising psychology got better at conning us into believing that despite very little reliable information, we could make sound political judgements and further that regardless of how bad our previous choices were, next time we would get it right.<br /><br />These factors, and the communications technology of the time created a self-amplifying cycle of the concentration of both media and political power.  If there were no other major forces at work then theory predicts that politics would become less stable and corruption would increase.<br /><br />Thing is, there are other factors at work.  Firstly the influence of the media industry is collapsing (7-West shares dropped from over $12 to $1.43) and global environmental imperatives are starting to bite.<br /><br />Those who control trillion dollar investments are beginning to appreciate that political instability fuelled by their competition to dominate it makes their plight even worse.<br /><br />This means that there is an emerging recognition that political systems must be made to be less susceptible to instability.  History has shown us that this imperative ultimately drives the movers and shapers from conservative to progressive political stances.<br /><br />The challenge for all political forces is to intelligently position themselves to attract the support they need to emerge from the coming transition as one of the two main blocs.<br /><br />The significant difference we all can make is to simply recognise that these big changes are underway and accelerating.  We should dismiss the &quot;same old, same old&quot; puerile evasive politics by paying respect to leaders who seek to describe a credible big picture political future.<br /></p>

The problem was that Labor appeared even worst and maybe they would have been.<br /><br />Its a matter of what is on offer that is at the core of the problem.<br /><br />Next election we might well get Shorten as the leader of the government. Now I don't have anything against him as such but I suspect that Morrison or Bishop will be the leader of the opposition and we will have a rerun of the Abbott nastiness. <br /><br />Shorten's government no matter how they try will be discredited by the likes of Murdoch and big business and we'll get yet another LNP jerk and around and around we will go.<br /><br />Enough is enough.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>It is not how power is exercised that matters, it is simply holding the power that matters and that is why we currently have such a sub-standard government. Abbott fought, threw tantrums and came up with Big New Lies and he won power - and just the way tired parents finally give way to a two year old's tantrums he got elected by us and the thing he sought to gain is now slowly destroying him - that destruction is thoroughly deserved in my opinion.</p>

	<p>The Abbott government is looking increasingly shakey, however, as a new government they were never given the go that all new governments get.<br /><br />They were and still are being stymied by Labor etc. in the senate for political reasons (because it is working for them) and they have had to put up with being held to ransom by Palmer,Lambie etc, etc.<br /><br />You may well whine about the Murdoch press, but the press as a whole has not taken the opposition and minor parties to task over their role in this current term of government.<br /><br />The previous government were well able to get legislation through, so you saw the exact result of what their plan was.<br /><br />You cannot and have not seen the result of this governments plans as they have been successfully stopped from governing the country.<br /><br />This is a ridiculous situation and as much as you or anyone else wants to say that this is democracy at work, it is not.<br /><br />The senates role is as a house of review, it is not there to stop a government (especially a new one) from doing what governments should do....................GOVERN.<br /><br />This is the most obstructionist senate I have seen, and it is all for political reasons, not for the good of the country.</p>

	<p>A good summary by a Liberal aligned commentator. Even the Liberals are realising there is a huge problem. What they interpret as a problem for the Liberal Party, is a bigger problem for Australia. (The Liberal Party urgently needs reform generally!)<br /><br />It is a defining point that Abbott can play the gender card, and not remember or care about Gillard etc. Breathtaking even from Abbott, but in degree only as he does this stuff all the time. Does he even realise it?<br /><br />But then, he was allowed to attack Gillard on an alleged slush fund, but was allowed to do so, ignoring his own slush fund Australians for Honest Politics and being caught out lying about in on national television and to other journalists. <br /><br />*Allowed* is the operative word. The Abbott media free pass. Now there is *some* scrutiny as he has burnt away some of the protection by the continued idiocies and malignancies and the narrative shifts to his failing and failings.  Too many are getting tired of being treated as idiots if nothing else.<br /><br />Similarly, Credlin is being forced out of the murk. Her gender is irrelevant, what is poisonous is the 'faceless' control and manipulation. She is going too far even for the Liberal Party - where does that leave the rest of us? <br /><br />The media free pass again. The issue of 'faceless' manipulators was able to be spun as a Labor only issue, with the willing involvement of most of the media. This is being revealed as the nonsense it always was. Not good for the Abbott/Credlin unit but better for us to minimise their damage.<br /><br />The right might whine about ABC bias in this being canvassed now, but it is only now. Not before when it was just as bad. The only 'bias' (or rather media failure) was the hiding of all this before. And the author here is a Liberal of course.<br /></p>

	<p>It's weak to blame Credlin. This is about the failure of the conservative branch of the LNP. No one is buying into their reckless push of ideological agendas onto the public. No one needs or wants government subsidised religious instructors in schools. No real liberal wants welfare for 'women of calibre' - who don't need it. No one wants an education review conducted by a closet fascist, who's only defence is that his emails were 'private', or a catholic apologist who is mourning an imaginary Australia that never existed. The public overwhelmingly trust the ABC, even if they don't toe the party line, since the commercial channels have long since abandoned investigative journalism in favour of celebrity interviews and home renovation shows.<br /><br />The public recognise that an overwhelming majority of scientists might be worth listening to - rather than Andrew Bolt, who couldn't complete an Arts degree (perhaps explaining his hostility to the subject). Or a weird melange of LNP front benchers who think god will prevent such any undesirable event from happening by magical intervention.<br /><br />They understand that privatisation of health and education has been a dismal, anti-social failure in other countries, and don't want it here. That natural monopolies can never be managed by private or corporate concerns in a way that puts the public interest first. That the whole reason that government was invented was to preserve the wealth of the commons. Not auction it off and declare it to be great economic management.<br /><br />The leadership of the LNP is intellectually impoverished. Joe Hockey and Malcolm Turnbull receive an allowance for living in investment properties they (of course, their 'spouses') already own, while calling for austerity. They offer plum government positions to members of the shadowy IPA, who denounce big government. Or stack the ABC board with News Corp stooges with no experience in a relevant field of media production, who still get marching orders from their disgusting boss, who gave up citizenship for more cash.<br /><br />If this is 'Team Australia' I want no part of it.<br /></p>

	<p>Gregory, why is it that as soon an article expresses an opinion of the PM or the LNP differs with yours' or any right-winger it and the writer are immediately branded as being from the left? I am guessing that you have done the maths and arrived at the 85% figure by an in depth analyses of posted articles over an extended time frame (say 24 months). <br /><br />There are still some of us that didn't vote Labor at the last election or indeed the one prior that are able to see just how much of an insult the PM is to our intelligence. The very fact that Credlin has become an issue within the party and among ministers to boot, reflects more on Abbott than her. The PM has lost control of his own office or abrogated his responsibilities and allowed/forced Credlin to take up the slack.<br /><br /> I agree there have been various people in the office of PM from both sides of politics over many years that have not had the control they perhaps should have, however none have been as lacking in people skills as the current incumbent, Abbott is let to learn that leadership is about far more than aggression and fear mongering. Australians are happy to be lead, but refuse to be pushed, members of Government are doing what any of us would do; pushing back and questioning the leadership.</p>

	<p>Which, seeing that to the best of my knowledge the ABC does not discriminate as to who is allowed to contribute to this site, means that (a) those from the left are over five times more literate, (b) that those from the left have over five times more things they'd like to say, or (c) NewsPoll is seriously flawed, and massive and widespread fraud is occurring at this country's elections. Your choice as to which I suppose.<br /><br />You really do need to stop blaming somebody else if zealots from &quot;your side&quot; fail to make use of the platforms available to them.

	<p>I think the only trip Abbott is on is an ego trip. <br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if the LNP did dump him at some stage next year. When a thumping at the next election looks like a certainty, then there's nothing to lose in taking a radical move. I also wouldn't be surprised if he dumped Julie Bishop at the forthcoming reshuffle. I'm thinking that relationship is probably getting to the point of being untenable. Bishop is looking dangerously competent compared to some others in the ministerial line up. <br /><br />Out of curiosity, how many people are starting to look more sympathetically at Julia Gillard now? <br /></p>

	<p>No Dave, it's about the large number of MPs who were flown in on the wings of Rupert who will not be re-elected and who will not get the lifetime pension and generous allowances and who blame Abbott for astounding incompetence.<br /><br />Abbott has set up Credlin to fail, by giving her inappropriate delegation and authority. Abbott has given an unelected public servant power to control and micro-manage the behavior of elected members of the Federal government and she obviously relishes the power and wields it most brutally.<br /><br />It beggars belief that he is such an amazing fool.</p>

	<p>Sigmamupi, being employed under an Act of Parliament is surely the very definition of being a public servant. Maybe by some re-interpretation of semantics she is really a private consultant or something but that would be even worse given she is telling elected MPs what to do and how.<br /><br />Granted, public servants employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act makes it possible to sack her summarily, which would certainly be on the cards if Abbott gets plucked by his fellow members.</p>

	<p>More than Abbott being an egotist or anything else this actually highlights his lack of imagination and vision.<br /><br />Two things a Prime Minister should really have.<br /><br />Rudd was an egotist, we all know that after what happened.<br /><br />While Gillard was competent and capable as a negotiator she lacked in other areas.<br /><br />A Prime Minister should have:<br />Vision<br />Compassion<br />Intelligence<br />Charisma<br />Integrity<br /><br />Unfortunately it seems our current system breeds out any compasison or integrity a leader might have well before they reach a senior position while vision and intelligence are not considered necessary traits for success in such an environment.</p>

	<p>I think that there needs to be a social vision for Australia, not so much an economic one. <br /><br />Economics is too narrow. It is like a house budget, we do need to balance the budget but we have to set our goals also. Ergo if we decide that we want to use social networking to enhance future job opportunities, investment in clothing and entertainment must be put in as a priority. <br /><br />NOBODY is presenting a vision for the future. <br /><br />And that is the problem. <br />Set the social goals first - and then budget in order to achieve them. <br /><br />I do not think LNP has an actual social vision for the future ... though many individuals within the party have one. <br /><br />Labour has also lost its vision and does not speak of it.<br /><br />We need a vision. It might be &quot;the smart country&quot; in which case we subsidize education. It might be&quot;cars are the future&quot; in which case we subsidize roads.  <br /><br />But there IS NO VISION!<br />And that is the problem. <br />Not politics, it is that we do not have a vision.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>Mark,<br /><br />&quot;Economics is too narrow. It is like a house budget&quot;<br /><br />The problem is not so much with economics, but with a particular type of economic dogma called &quot;neo-liberalism&quot; that sees economics as &quot;like a household budget&quot;.<br /><br />In reality, economic and social policy are inseparable. The art of government is to produce complimentary social and economic policy, and to manage the interaction of these in a manner that facilitates progress toward identified social and economic goals. I think that these identified social and economic goals are probably what you are talking about when you say &quot;vision&quot;.<br /><br />This is where an entity called &quot;the political party&quot; should come in. The role of a political party is to develop and promote a long-term vision for a society, and then to implement this long-term vision through specific short and medium term policy that, by its nature, is more responsive to the social and economic landscape at the time.<br /><br />The problem is that the way politics is presented to us by the popular press and electronic media encourages us to base our voting choices on short-term and largely irrelevant issues over which no elected government has much control.<br /><br />I'm not sure how we can get out of this bind. I suspect that it is largely up to us as individuals to stop listening to the chatter of the popular media and re-engage with politics on a more fundamental and organic level - through our local progress associations and resident's groups, our unions, our workplaces, our churches, our schools and universities and our political parties. And we need to insist on long-term thinking, and make our electoral choices based on how closely each party's short and medium term policies align most closely with the long term vision that you prefer.<br /><br />Perhaps we can manage it...but I am not sure. But it would be worth giving it a try at least.</p>

	<p>Further deflection, diversion and distraction by Mr Abbott. The question was about whether the criticism of his office was an indirect criticism of his performance, not really Credlin's performance. To avoid answering the question, Mr Abbott did what Julie Bishop accused Gillard of doing - he &quot;played&quot; Credlin as &quot;a victim&quot; to deflect criticism from himself. He presented Credlin, rather than his whole office and himself as the focus of the criticism and used Credlin's gender to protect himself from criticism. Such a move may not endear him with women voters.</p>

With the Ukrainian leader, he said &quot;It's nice to be popular, even if it's only in Kiev&quot;, which, while said light-heartedly and was obviously directed at his own political situation, probably left Poroshenko feeling pretty alone.

	<p>I think it is official that Abbott must have some kind of memory and/or mental disorder.<br /><br />I just can't see how he can get any worse. I'm genuinely concerned that there is a problem with him. This is way beyond foot in mouth. I know an autistic kid who everyone pretends is normal who just comes out with things that are equally disconnected from reality.<br /><br />Whatever problem he has may also explain his blind ideological push and tunnelvision and single-minded mission to represent the corporate agenda of those who have invested in his party.

	<p>Ideology, whatever its focus, indicates a mental disorder.....a lack of capacity to be able to look at and evaluate evidence and information, and an inability to think for oneself and put ideas together in new and creative ways to solve problems.  Abbott goes further, he seems to have no comprehension of what he is actually saying and doing or of the need for some sort of consistency and logic.  I am surprised at how willing people have been to try and pretend his view of the world is &quot;normal&quot;.  The other problem is, Abbott is not the only person in the government who is completely driven by ideology!</p>

	<p>There's nothing wrong with ideology per se.<br /><br />One could have an ideology which has a &quot;focus&quot; on &quot;looking at and evaluating evidence&quot; or any of the other ideals you have mentioned. (The fact they are 'ideals' is a good clue they can be the focus of an 'ideology'.)<br /><br />The problem with ideology is when they're based on money and power, rather than on people (i.e. others). Sadly such ideologues are not limited to the LNP. You've overlooked the Tweedle-dee party (the current ALP, in case I have to spell it out).</p>

	<p>There is a thing called a cognitive disorder and it is not classed by the above categories.<br /><br />People who do not have such a condition pass external judgements like &quot;stubborn&quot; or &quot;not listening&quot; or whatever on a person who has such a condition, and they base their judgement on another assuming the person can think &quot;normally.&quot;<br /><br />As one person said - if it takes all your effort to find the most paltry &quot;cause and effect&quot; you cling to it, ignoring that is is only a part of what others see, or the wider picture. <br />Others call you stubborn, wilful, narrow etc. but it is ONLY that this is all you can do. <br /><br />I think Abbot has such a condition. I think that it prevents him achieving his goals. It is as though he sees what he wants to do, makes a plan, sets it in motion - it fails. <br /><br />Most people look at what happens and adapt, modify, adjust and find a way to achieve the goal. <br />Abbott does not seem able to do so. The key is not ABLE - not unwilling, UNABLE to do so. <br /><br />I can judge Mr Abbott in quite a number of ways. Often extremely negatively. What he DOES and the harm he does in the process. <br /><br />But I do not dare judge HIM. I cannot see what is inside  of his mind, nor of his heart for that matter.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

	<p>Mark D, you took lack of self awareness to levels. You have no such insight to come to those conclusions.<br /><br />Peta Credlin has been in the news because of private conversations with conservative MPs complaining about her. Like some of the idiotic remarks above about who was Rudd's adviser, we  know about Credlin because the media think it was news or more correctly, a gotcha moment.<br /><br />Tony Abbot screwed up by trying to be clever. He should have just said. It wouldn't have been news if it was Peter and not Peta. Although the truth is, it wouldn't have been news if it wasn't Tony Abbott.</p>

	<p>Hello Pete,<br /><br />You should probably switch to the commercial networks. Do it soon Pete, because you will find it enlightening and might give some balance to your perspective.  Some comment on commercial networks is pretty scathing of the current government.  Channel 10's The Project is worth a look. Channel 7's news reporting on the government makes the ABC look pretty tame.</p>

	<p>Nope, Judy Bee.<br /><br />If Pete wants to watch right-leaning pro-government rubbish being continually spouted, he should watch the ABC.<br /><br />Nowhere else can you find so many IPA and Sydney Institute spokespeople and, what with them spouting their neo-liberal agenda and defence of the indefensible LNP government's actions and words, but you also have so many of the ABC's own staff supporting the government - no doubt trying to make sure that, if they are retrenched from the BC in the government cuts, they'll be able to move seamlessly to the Murdoch and Fairfax media.</p>

	<p>Gday Pete <br />Maybe you should write to the PM and ask him not to make public  comments suggesting that it's what a persons gender is which influences others views of the work they do ?<br />It must be frustrating that all other news and commentators are questioning the leadership style and course set by the government eh ?<br />The other day even A. Jones suggested that Abbott could go the way of Howard because of decisions his government had made.</p>

	<p>Nope. You may not withdraw your taxes from the ABC. <br /><br />No more than healthy young people who take private health insurance can withdraw their tax funds from the public health system, or child-less parents can get a tax deduction for paying for the education of other people's children. Neither can you &quot;take back your tax&quot; instead of it being spent on roads on the other side of the state that you may not personally drive on, or for military hardware if you happen to be a pacifist. <br /><br />Tax is paid to the government and disposed of according to the determination of the House of Representatives. You may not like what happens with your taxes, but that's too bad. Contrary to the long-standing platitude many uncritically accept as fact, tax revenue raised by the government is not &quot;our&quot; money. Once we have been parted from it by the mandate and legal force of the state operating in the guise of the tax authority, the money is no longer under our control or influence, and it is not &quot;our&quot; possession under law. <br /><br />Rather it becomes public money circulating around public institutions, and will be spent according to someone else's concept of the public good. Sometimes their concept is shared by ourselves, but in many instances it is not.</p>

	<p>I've read many pieces in the last couple of weeks in regards to the gripes about Credlin and the need for Abbott to reflect on what's happening within his government let alone his office. That's the problem, Abbott is not gifted with introspection. His personality seems to be entirely bent on the domination of others. He needs to prove his power time and again even if he puts himself in danger. <br /><br />Back when he was a minister in the Howard government he relied on Howard himself sallying forth to save his skin. Credlin did well  harnessing the pugnacious elements of Abbott's personality in opposition. And either she too is only gifted with beligerance or she can't harness diplomacy in Abbott as he doesn't have any.  In any event this is a train at full tilt, no breaks and heading towards a collapsing bridge.</p>

	<p>&quot;Credlin did well harnessing the pugnacious elements of Abbott's personality in opposition.&quot;<br /><br />In Abbott's defence of Credlin, he sang her praises on how well she did in opposition.  He does not seem to make the leap to the obvious that sewing chaos and destruction, done skilfully, works well in opposition, but being in government needs more of a constructive, consultative, and calming personality.  Maybe Peta hasn't made the transition any better than he has.</p>

	<p>For me it's about what I think is good for my country and I supported the party I believe would end the farcical boat situation and do something about the Labor debt legacy. We all knew Tony Abbotts penchant of talking first thinking later but you hoped the guy would finely get the message.<br /><br />When Tony Abbott said with conviction if the LNP could not get his reforms past the Senate he would call an election I believe him and I supported the concept because stalled legislation is not good for the country. And he backed down and then for me the first real crack had opened and down it goes the old familiar cycle has begun. It's goodbye Tony.</p>

	<p>&quot;When Tony Abbott said with conviction...&quot;<br /><br />That's not all he said with conviction gbe. He also said: There will not be deals done with independents and minor parties under any political movement that I lead (August 4th 2013).<br /><br />It's not difficult to see that promise didn't last long.<br /><br />I applaud you for your candour. It's not always easy to admit one was wrong, but I sense TA is helping you change your opinion about him.</p>

	<p>Oh Graazt, why do you torment me like this?  The coalition won the election.  There was no hung parliament, and if there was, that was the context on August 4th 2013.  There was no need to do a deal with the greens and three independents, as in the 2010 hung parliament.  If there had been for some reason a draw, then there would not have been a repeat of the deals done the last time - that was the promise.   I know this is hard for you to work out, but you can't break a promise if the situation in which the promise made would have applied never eventuated.<br /><br />It didn't happen, because the coalition won the election outright, so there was never any point in doing a deal with Christine Milne to begin with.  If there had been a hung parliament, and Abbott had done a special deal with the greens to form a government, then that would have been a break of promise.  However, there wasn't because there was no hung parliament in 2013.  Please try to pay attention next election and I hope now you understand the last one a little better now.  Have a good weekend. <br /><br /></p>

	<p>Ben, the words that Abbott spoke are the only context I need. <br /><br />Abbot made the promise in the hope that it would swing enough votes to give him control of both houses of parliament. It didn't work in the Senate and now he would sell his grandmother to get his legislation through the upper house. For instance, holding kids hostage to get his TPV legislation up.</p>

	<p>Hi gbe<br />I appreciate your comment above regarding putting our country first, and, although I never had any hopes of the Libs doing so, I am very downhearted over the curent state of dissarray. It appears Labour may well get another crack for simply being not Abbott, and our country will more than likely continue to suffer.<br />I voted for Bob Katter- he couldn't even point to NSW on a map, but the bloke seems to have integrity anyway. I remember an interview with hime many years ago whan he was asked his opinion on something, and replied to the effect that he didn't have an opinion until his constituents told him what his opinion was.<br />Shame the majors don't think like he does...<br />I hope next year is better for you and me both.<br />Cheers.<br /></p>

	<p>I disagree Gert. Surely the politician is there to REPRESENT their constituents , not make their own decisions?<br />I would suggest some of the problems the LNP are having is that they are making their own decisions, not listening to the people. I recenlty read a quote from a notable along the lines of &quot;I am their leader, I must follow them&quot;, and it makes sense to me.<br />I am from NSW, and as I said before, I doubt Mr Katter could point to my state ( or want to), but he will represent me just as well as the  Nationals bloke who's had the job for the last decade or so.<br />Cheers</p>

	<p>If Credlin is to be a pivotal player in the government, she should be elected minister and member of the cabinet. Why does our democracy  allow an unelected person to have more authority than a cabinet member? Tony Abbott needs to change course or the LNP will reap the whirlwind they have sown. There is no mandate to deregulate higher education and universities, and no mandate to undertake severe austerity measures. If they do not change course and abandon programs which were not presented before they were elected, then they will be a one term government.</p>

	<p>She is Chief of Staff and runs the Prime Minister's Office. All parties have one, it is a role of government. It is not the same as being an MP or a Minister. Prime Minister's also have advisers, this occurs the world over. The roles are very different.  Oh and you really think that what has been proposed in teh budget are 'serious austerity measures' (remember overall government spending is still increasing year on year) you are in a big shock the day when actual, real austerity measures come into affect (which could happen if we do not reign in our spending)</p>

	<p>When the foreign minister in a government seems to be complaining about orders from the PM's office, not even the PM, then something is very wrong.  In our system of government, elected members who are accountable to their electorates, are supposed to be working together to decide policy necessary for our collective functioning and well-being.  It is not appropriate for these people to be side-lined.  It is not appropriate for any non-elected individual in the PM's office to be controlling access to the PM by elected members of parliament, other than in an administrative capacity.<br /><br />For people to claim that because Credlin was highly influential in the strategy that put the current government in power, MP's should continue to tolerate her, states loudly and clearly that the government is only about power and staying in power.  It makes a mockery of any stated concern for the people of Australia and democracy.  I was opposed to Rudd because of his centralization of power.  Abbot is no better.  Maybe independents are our only option.</p>

	<p>I'm sorry but it is the Left who are hypocrites - any criticism of Julia and they screeched misogyny!!!  Tony Abbott was right in suggesting that a lot of the criticism was based on her performance. I was critical of her performance but no-one could claim I am a misogynist (I am female) Tony also has a right to his point of view that Peta is copping a lot of flak due to her gender. Julia complained endlessly about gender politics, trying to drum up sympathy, whereas Peta just gets on with it.  Lets face it - there has been a lot of criticism and news articles critical of  Credlin in the ABC and Fairfax and a lot of it has been very nasty (ie choosing unflattering pics of her etc) So please, Miss Mathewson and the Left, spare us the double standards.</p>

For that, maybe, he is toast. All the rest of this is pure snark.</p>

	<p>Yep I was thinking that the other day. I'm reading a book at the moment on events in the Reagan presidency and he, like George W, Bush, seems also to be a role model for Abbott. Or is it that all really conservative politicians talk and act in the same way. They give me the impression that there's a disconnect somewhere in their brains when either inappropriate or just plain silly comments pop out. When things are really grim they make some remark and instead of calming the discussion it fires it up. <br /><br />We all know that Credlin is Abbott's Liberal Party appointed minder because his ascension to the leadership in 2009 was quite unexpected and left to his own devices he'd never be able to cut the mustard as either Opposition Leader or PM, yet occasionally out pops some comment that gives the impression he's trying to shake off the straight jacket. He's showing, what must be quite worrying to Credlin, a tendency to have thought bubbles again (the embarrassment of the PPL revisited) - I suspect the count down for his replacement has begun.</p>

This is a dispute that is purely in the Liberal Party and it will undermine him. Politicians are always mindful of the fact come an election they can get fired and they don't want their elected leader ignoring their input because his CoS thinks that they have the real power.

	<p>I was very disappointed to hear Mr Abbott's interview over this matter.   In many ways his response, apart from being a bit silly, simply appeared to shift the blame for failings in his office away from him.<br /><br />At the end of the day as PM he is responsible for how his office is run.  If the gatekeepers are limiting access it has to be assumed that it is on his instructions.  Otherwise an unelected official is denying access of elected MPs to the PM.   Such a situation would be untenable and should be addressed immediately.   <br /><br />It concerns me that Mr Abbott seems unwilling to take a step back, regroup and re-enter the fray with a coherent strategy.   In military parlons, retreat, regroup and re-engage.   <br /><br />Sometimes it's good PR to admit a problem and address it rather than blame others.<br /><br />When Ms Gillard used the sexism charge it put the final nail in her political coffin as far as I was concerned.   Mr Abbott's use of the card says more to me about him than it does about the situation.</p>

	<p>Edward as we know the government of the day holds office because it has the majority in the Lower House - if, as it appears, the PM's CoS has decided who can and who can't offer advice or an opinion to the PM they all elected, then something is seriously out of whack in our democracy. And that applies equally to all parties who hold the majority in the House. <br /><br />I know it has become accepted practice on both sides but that does not make it right. The rather pissant issue of sexism doesn't come into it.</p>

	<p>Malcolm,<br /><br />I agree that the &quot;sexism issue&quot; is irrelevant and reflects more on the PM in his raising it more than anything else.<br /><br />With regard to the issue of access to the PM, I'm a little more pragmantic.   I have no problems with limiting day to day meetings if a PM sticks to an agenda agreed to by the parliamentary party and the Cabinet.   I start to get concerns when the PM starts making policy off his/her own bat.   This is something that all three of the last PMs have done and is unacceptable.<br /><br />In any event all major changes in policy direction should be dealt with by the party room before being announced.   It makes a mockery of democracy when party members are required to vote for something that they have had no say in developing.  If I were a back bencher and that happened on my watch I'd be pushing for a spill of all positions.   And that's why I will never be a back bencher!</p>

	<p>'This lack of reflection is breath taking-even for Abbott&quot; <br /><br />So true but I suggest that lack of reflection is as breath taking for much of the LNP in general as it is for the PM.<br /><br />They were all standing there behind him when he was accusing Gillard of using the gender card. As far as I can recall not one of them jumped on that low life who wrote that disgusting menu featuring Gillard.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind that Julia Gillard was subjected to sexism- there are still too many dumb blokes around- undoubtedly some are on the LNP benches.<br /><br />So there is probably some truth in what Abbott said-his big mistake was in not reflecting that Julia Gillard had  a point.   <br /><br />I find it interesting that both Rudd and now Abbott seem to be control freaks with an office to match.\<br /><br />A non reflective control freak is the worst kind of leader.</p>

	<p>Thanks, Paula. My mind now spinning with what ifs, buts &amp; in that cases ...  I keep coming back to, can the LNP roll Abbott?  If so, how would the spin that?  There would be clip after clip on their Rudd/Gillard commentary.  But if so, given the general distaste for the budget, would they inch back toward the centre?  Would it  be a reset beyond anything we've ever seen or more of the same under a new captain?  Interesting times.</p>

One Liberal Minister, Kevin Cairns, was a personal friend.  My feelings towards Abbott is just a strange human alienation. I can't understand what he is hoping to achieve with an endless succession of idiotically damaging policies, each of which ensures damage to Australia and damage to his Party and himself.  <br /><br />Abbott is truly weird.<br /></p>
