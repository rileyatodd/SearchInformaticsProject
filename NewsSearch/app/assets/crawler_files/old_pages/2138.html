  <p><strong><em>A Senate report has reiterated that if you treat human beings in a way that is callous, cruel or oppressive, then violence follows. It is inexcusable that Reza Berati died, writes Greg Barns.</em></strong></p><p>Senate Committees examining politically contentious issues often produce partisan reports which do not assist in the understanding of the issues at hand. The Senate Committee into the death of a detainee at the Manus Island immigration centre in February of this year is fortunately an exception to the rule.</p><p>While the Coalition MPs on the committee predictably dissented from the majority view adopted by Labor and the Greens, the evidence gathered by the committee supports the recommendations and findings it has made.</p><p>It is a pity that Immigration Minister Scott Morrison and the Abbott Government are simply wishing the Manus Island report away and playing politics over the tragic death of Iranian asylum seeker Reza Berati between February 16-18 this year.</p><p>Mr Morrison wants to blame the Papua New Guinea government and the former Rudd government, which cut a deal with Port Moresby to house asylum seekers at the Manus Island centre. Instead, Mr Morrison needs to remember that he and his department have a non-delegable duty of care to ensure the safety of those it detains, irrespective of the location of detention.</p><p>The 201-page report sets out clearly how the Manus Island centre had been mismanaged in the months leading up to the February riots, and it concludes that the prospect of violence was certainly foreseeable.</p><p>This conclusion appears reasonable given that even the Abbott Government's own investigator Robert Cornall found in his assessment, published in May this year, that delays, lack of information about the PNG resettlement process, and the anger of asylum seekers, frustrated at the prospect of not reaching Australia, all contributed to the violence that erupted in February and which resulted in Mr Berati's death.</p><p>Those of us who have visited prisons and detention centres over the years know one thing - if you treat human beings in a way that is callous, cruel or oppressive, then violence follows. Prison riots in Australia have occurred over the past few decades (most infamously Bathurst, Pentridge in Melbourne and Fremantle) because the authorities had allowed such conditions to develop.</p><p>There is little point in doing what the Coalition senators on the Manus Island Committee, Ian Macdonald and Linda Reynolds, are doing in their short dissenting report, and that is seek to paint the majority report as a political exercise. Violence occurred at Manus Island in February this year because the Australian government and its contractors mismanaged the place.</p><p>It needs to be remembered also that the Australian Government is the appropriate entity to compensate Mr Berati's family for the loss of his life. The Commonwealth recently conceded in the Supreme Court of Victoria, in a decision handed down last month called AS v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, that it has a non-delegable duty to provide reasonable health care to detainees.</p><p>That duty of care extends to ensuring that if the Commonwealth reasonably foresees that violence is brewing, it has to take steps to ensure the safety of detainees. That duty of care is also non-delegable.</p><p>The Manus Island Senate report's other recommendations ought not to be controversial in a civilised liberal democratic society. Recommendation 5 of the report is particularly important, and yet the Abbott Government is baulking at its implementation.</p><p>Recommendation 5 is about ensuring that UN representatives, lawyers, the Human Rights Commission, and journalists have access to the Manus Island centre and be allowed to meet with centre staff and detainees.</p><p>We are talking about persons who are detained for extensive periods of time, who have committed no offence, and who in many cases are traumatised by their life experiences. That these people ought to be able to speak to lawyers, human rights officials, the media and UN representatives should be something that occurs as a matter of course. It is entirely consistent with Australia's international human rights obligations about treatment of people in detention.</p><p>But Senator McDonald and Senator Reynolds have opposed this recommendation, arguing that this would infringe on Papua New Guinea's sovereignty! This is a claim that cannot be taken seriously given that the only reason the Manus Island centre is open is because of Australia's insistence that it will not fulfil its international law obligations to assess and process claims for refugee status within Australia. Papua New Guinea is a pawn in Australian political games.</p><p>The Manus Island report is an important document, not only because it deals sensibly with the issue of responsibility for violence resulting in death and seeks to improve transparency at the centre, but because it focuses again on the sheer cruelty of Australia's treatment towards asylum seekers.</p><p>It is inexcusable that serious violence happens in detention centres at all.</p><p><em>Greg Barns is a spokesman for the Australian Lawyers Alliance and barrister.

	<p>Yeah - whatever it takes right?  It's ok to sweep a couple of murders under the carpet if it stops those damn boats.<br /><br />The stupid thing is that the boats could have been stopped years ago without resorting to such abject cruelty if the LNP had supported the Malaysia solution.  But they chose to get into bed with the Greens and block it so that they could use it as a political football.</p>

	<p>Gary, while any death is terrible, it is a long bow to blame the action of this government for his death.  He was a rioter killed by a PNG national.  Mis adventure came in to it a bit.  It is fair enough to point out that the law lobby has benefitted from the refugee industry, and are the main proponents for it's return.  This has been a huge milch cow for the lawyers, and are happy to promote it's return.</p>

	<p>Gary, if you think the boats would have stopped with the Malaysia solution you're smoking something.  The deal was to exchange 800 asylum seekers for 4,000 from Malaysia.  800 asylum seekers were arriving in less than a week.  We'd have done the swap, gained 4,000 in their place, and it would be back to business as usual within a week.</p>

	<p>lazarus- In case you might have missed it, the illegal immigration industry, set up by Rudd and fed by Gillard has cost the taxpayers far in excess of $12 BILLION dollars, up till 2013 and it's only the fact that off shore processing has been stopped that the costs are slowing. As we see every time a pregnant illegal immigrant from Nauru or Manus is brought to the mainland for free, taxpayer funded hospital treatment and the birth of their new baby, the lawyers are right there making their claims that the woman, and family of course, should be allowed to stay because their new child was born in Australia and should be given Australian citizenship? Give me a break.</p>

	<p>Yank- An enquiry about what the Abbott government has or hasn't done? The Abbott government is following the system championed and started by your hero, Rudd the Mobile Ego. The thing that people like you forget is that no country should, or must, allow it's borders to be abused by anyone, for any reason but particularly people who are affluent enough to fly themselves around the world and employ criminals to deliver them to another country's back door, uninvited and un authorised, who invariably immediately start demanding every benefit known to man and riot and destroy taxpayer owned property if they don't get what they demand. Personally, and in the absence of any figures from people such as your good self telling us exactly how many of these people would you suggest that Australia can absorb, and at what cost, I'm perfectly that we now have a government with the balls and backbone to do what the vast majority of Australians said they wanted them to do. If things are so bad for you in Australia, maybe you could consider heading off back to the land of milk and honey?</p>

	<p>I do not see how the Senate Committee report, which predictably voted along Party lines can be seen as unbiased. The Labor Party reopened Manus Centre, and set conditions for its operation. Why cannot everyone accept that responsibility is shared by both them and LNP? Especially when virtually all detainees arrived under Labor.<br />But LNP must clean up the mess. Now that they have TPVs to work with, I think unfortunately that there is no alternative but to release most detainees in Australia. Maintain Operation Sovereign Borders, work with Indonesia, process the 10000 there;  we have about 5 years worth of asylum claimants all over the place who took advantage of Labor's weak stance. I would not like to be a low wage earner who does not qualify for public housing, trying to compete for jobs and housing and services with the influx.<br />At the time of Refugee convention, there were about 2.5 billion people in the world.7.4billion now, projected 10.5+ by the end of the century. It is time to give notice ( 1 year required) that it needs to be reworked. The five grounds for asylum were a response to political oppression. It was never envisaged in that age of snail-like transportation and no computers etc. that vast numbers of people would try to move country. They do not fit the requirement for asylum.Because the reality today is that underlying all of the turmoil in the world, people are competing for jobs, food, water, land, energy. The religious struggle in Iraq is as much about whose lands encompass the oil, the water, the crops, as about nasty religious fanaticism.<br />The developed world has to work on limiting its consumption, and it is therefore the worst place to put vast numbers of extra people. All of Un's programmes are shadowed by the vital imperative of limiting population increase in the developing world. It's out of control, people.</p>

	<p>Spot on Rae. These privatised prison operators take a handsome fee from the government, and it's ludicrous to expect the government to cough up compensation when it was their systems that failed. They're not entirely responsible as far as compensation goes: the other inmates (let's get real: it's a prison) and the locals who inflamed the situation bear some responsibilty. Nothing about this sad situation is an argument to dismantle the government's tough approach to the people smuggler trade, but all sides of politics are disingenous when it comes to apportioning blame, or explaining the factors behind the violence. It is inevitable that there will be outbreaks of violence when you have a seriously upset population who've realised they've wasted their fortune on people smugglers, and are prompted to undertake never-ending legal appeals by the refugee lobby and its lawyers. This last factor is the most significant contributor to the psychological damage off shore processing creates, and I often wonder where the lawyer's motivation lies...their client's mental health doesn't seem to factor, given Australia has made it utterly clear that paying a people smuggler to fast-track residency in Australia is absolutely off the table. Their efforts would be better spent convincing the voters that coming to Australia via a boat is an acceptable way to get residency. On this count, for the time being, they've lost, but they could at least force the government to own up and leave the outdated refugee convention - something that probably has widespread support given the LNP's poll success over the issue. My own preference is that if governments want to incarcerate people, they should damn well run the places through state-run resources - the outsourcing of incarceration just presents too many conflicted objectives for it to be done properly by private companies, as we see time and time again. I don't believe these outfits are more efficient than the public service: rather they cost the same, are about as inefficient as each other, and simply enrich the owners.</p>

	<p>That all depends on wether the operator was running the operation on Govt guidelines via the contract.<br />Like the doctors , whom the Govt has complained continue to be doctors , rather than doing their job the way the Govt wants them to do it.<br />So in short , if the Govt (Labor or Liberal) has told them to be as harsh as possible so that asylum seekers go home , how can it be the operators fault when one dies as a result of this direction.<br />Also , you may have noticed a certain pink batt investigation? That had the Govt blaming the old Govt for the deaths and offering compo.</p>

Greg wants human rights lawyers who stand to make lots of money dragging and re dragging every case through the courts.  Millions in taxpayers dollars, who cares spend away.<br />Then we have the UN committee loaded to the hilt with a UN block members with an agenda to run and reports to draft before they even step into an area.

They are sitting and suffering in a no-man's land, they don't know what is going to happen to them.

	<p>Really, you right the most outrageous, mind numbing nonsense. <br /><br />There remains the fact that Morrison has saved lives. <br /><br />It is completely and utterly irrefutable. Not to mention the fact that they are not imprisoned on any of the Camps that The ALP reopened. They are free to leave.<br /><br />Encouraging as you and your husband were, would have led to thousands and thousands of boats. All vying for a pice of coastline. That means potentially thousands of deaths. Yes thousands of drownings.<br /><br />There are 40 million looking for help. As soon as Australia stopped turning the boats around, the wealthy few million would be on boats risking their lives.<br /><br />Don't you feel any guilt at all?. Or can you just 'not' figure it out?</p>

	<p>Bev, you and others continue with the lies about deaths of Asylum Seekers at sea and in Australian care. The Government does not keep these statistics but Monash University has studied this question and their database is recognised as the most comprehensive and accurate available.<br /><br />According to their database between 2000 and 2007, during Howards tenure and his pacific solution period, there were 746 reported deaths of asylum seekers. Of those, 363 asylum seekers died at sea while on their way to Australia. As well, 350 were presumed dead (their status is missing at sea with status unknown); 22 died in detention (the majority of those cases were suicide, but there were some deaths of natural causes); and 11 people were returned to Afghanistan and reportedly murdered.<br /><br />Between 2008 and 2013, under Labor, 877 asylum seekers had reportedly died. Of those, 15 committed suicide or died of natural causes in detention centres. So during this period, approximately 862 individuals died trying to reach Australia?s mainland to seek asylum. <br /><br />Since Operation Sovereign Borders, the secrecy surrounding the operation has made data collection impossible and thus I suspect we will never know the full extent of deaths at sea. <br /><br />I do not and never will hold any Australian Government of any persuasion responsible for these deaths at sea. I do not believe in the 'pull factor' BS and the short sighted punitive measures. Its the 'push factors' that cause people to leave their lands and subsequently leave Indonesia and such. In their own countries they are persecuted and in Indonesia they have absolutely no rights and no future. They come to Australia because they have no realistic option in their own country or in the countries they pass through to live in peace and with dignity. The are pushed to do what they do.<br /><br />I don't expect you to think as I do, but please stop spreading the malicious lie espoused by the LNP and repeated by people like yourself. If you are going to hold Labor responsible for the 877 deaths on their watch then you have to hold Howard responsible for the 746 deaths on his watch and Abbott for the yet undetermined number on his watch. To do anything else is pure HYPOCRISY.</p>

	<p>I suspect Greg doesn't know much about PNG. If he did he would know that PNG is a wonderful country where people are expected to show respect. Respect to each other and to authority. Truly it is sad that a young man died, and I will speculate how this happened. I say that residents of the detention centre showed a lack of respect which after time became unacceptable to the PNG nationals and there was retaliation. While we might be saddened by the mans death, it should not mean an open door to Australia. This will result in more deaths at sea and at the hands of people smugglers.</p>

	<p>This report should be sparking national outrage. It is unthinkable that Australia is treating people this way. We are not allowed much information about what goes on at Manus but this report gives us a little - and what it shows us is terrible. We should be on the streets demanding change. But instead this is buried half-way down the ABC page and has a paltry four comments, two of them in all seriousness claiming that human rights lawyers are only interested for their own financial gain. What has happened to you Australia?</p>

	<p>When considering the circumstances of the violence at the detention centre it should be remembered that the majority had chosen to place themselves there by attempting to facilitate Australian residency via people smuggler. The majority would have resisted all efforts to get them out of immigration detention unless the destination was Australia.<br /><br />It should also be remembered that in the past there has been several instances of well coordinated violence from those in detention causing many millions of dollars of damage to taxpayer funded facilities and to the best of my knowledge it has been too difficult to hold the people smugglers clients responsible for their actions. It is not unreasonable to speculate that at least part of the inspiration for the tragic events was the fact that in the past many got away with arson and malicious damage.</p>

	<p>A trip to Australia via a human trafficker definitely provides death as a foreseeable event.  In the first instance, you many drown. In the second instance you will end up in a detention camp where violence may occur at any time. As asylum seekers realise that the money spent has produced no returns, a sense of frustration takes over and then violence. Human rights and UN personnel have not helped by providing false hopes. The latter is a very good reason to keep these people out of the camps. <br /><br />Payment of money to a human trafficker cannot not should not be a down payment on permanent residency for you and your family in Australia. Australia has a process for selection and it is up to asylum seekers to abide by these processes not circumvent them simply to increase their chances. The government must be resolute in making a voyage to Australia as unattractive as possible.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>Agreed. Gasp. Traveling across countries and oceans is a very dangerous occupation. I'm not sure what the deaths in (Australian) custody figures are per 100,000 but having someone die like this in a detention centre, whilst tragic and probably preventable(ish) is going to happen one day. What we have on this site are those who are trying to assign culpability based not on events, but on politics.</p>

	<p>I have just re-read the 78 page document: &quot;Beyond the Boats: building an asylum and refugee policy for the long term&quot;.  This is the report of a conference convened by Australia 21, The Centre for International Refugee Law at the UNSW, and The Centre for Policy Development (all of which, see, if any are interested).<br /><br />Amongst the many (and somewhat varied) suggestions of a dedicated and knowledgeable group of people, one sine qua non suggestion from Fred Cheney stands out. He says, amongst other things:<br />&quot;---it is essential to have transparency around what is happening as the only guarantee against oppression and brutal behaviour&quot;.<br /><br />Of all that has been wrong and/or mistaken by successive Australian governments over the last 20 odd years, the current secrecy is potentially the worst aspect of any of these policies, and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />It is hard to disagree with the view of some of those at the conference that the Australian community needs to come to some coherent understanding and rational response so as to bring politicians to a position where their decisions and actions are informed by knowledge, humanity and what can be reasonably achieved.<br /><br />I am not sure just how this is to be done - but its necessity is fairly obvious.<br /><br />Surely enough damage has already been done - in Australia and internationally.</p>

	<p>I'm missing something.<br /><br />it didn't happen in Australia. It didn't happen by Australians, and Australian does not run the centre.<br /><br />but we have to pay compo for a death in a riot after people threatened to rape and kill the local women, and the locals got upset over that ?<br /><br />why not have png pay it ? They oversee in.<br /><br />why not have the contracting company pay it. They man it<br /></p>

	<p>&quot;...callous, cruel or oppressive, then violence follows&quot;, I can only think you mean the way the illegals were treating the local staff at the detention centre. I live and work in PNG and can tell you the local people are generally quite lovely but they will only take being called racist names, monkey noises and being spat at for so long before they react.</p>

	<p>Civilised people don't engage in violence. Ethical people don't invade other countries without authority. On these grounds none of these supposed asylum seekers should be granted any right to remain. We frequently hear of crimes committed here by those granted refugee status: the crime rates seem to be very high. In fact, we're being far too generous to these people, and cruel to ourselves by allowing them to stay here i the first place.</p>
