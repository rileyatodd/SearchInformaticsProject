<p>2.  <strong>Term and Termination</strong>.

<p>3.2 using the Services to develop, create or directly price any index (e.g., any composite financial index), data feed services, valuations services to third parties or any database or service that competes directly with the Services or any other BOAT service offered in the market place or that would create a substitute for any such BOAT service. For the avoidance of doubt, the Services shall not be used in any index or to create, price or calculate indices or any similar derivative product (including but not limited to "baskets" and "strategies"). For example, a total return index on the trading strategy or total return of investment strategy in relation to a structured product whose performance is based on a quantitative trading strategy, and the daily/weekly NAV or redemption value together with the Services are used to calculate such index; and</p>

Customer and End User may also create and include "Derived Data" in its periodic or ad-hoc reports to its clients. <strong>"Derived Data"</strong> shall mean, for the purposes of these terms and conditions only, data that Customer and/or End User have developed through a process in conjunction with additional third party data and professional experience, such that the Derived Data: (i) cannot be identified or reverse-engineered as originating or directly derived from the Services; (ii) includes an amount of the Services that has no independent commercial value; (iii) is not separately marketed by Customer; (iv) could not be used by its recipients as a substitute for the Services or any part of it; (v) has no commercial value in its own right, irrespective of whether that value is realised by the Customer or not; and (vi) the distribution of Derived Data is only of supportive nature to Customer and End User's services (for example - report on End User's performance) and does not constitute a service that End User's clients may subscribe for.</p>
<p>5.  <strong>Intellectual Property</strong>. All copyright, database rights, trade marks, patents, rights of privacy or publicity and other proprietary or intellectual property rights (including all models, software, data and any materials) comprised in all or any of the Services, or their provision, and all enhancements, modifications or additional services thereto, are and will be the exclusive property of BOAT.

<p>8.  <strong>Indemnity</strong>. Customer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless BOAT and its affiliates from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs brought by any third party accessing of all or part of the Services through or by means of Subscriber.</p>
<p>9.  <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>. The terms and conditions herein, solely in connection with the Services:</p>
<p>9.1 shall supersede any other terms between Customer and Vendor;</p>
<p>9.2 shall be for the benefit of BOAT, its data providers and its and their respective affiliates;</p>
