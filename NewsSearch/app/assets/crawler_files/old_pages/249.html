Risk was assessed based on factors like sensation-seeking and prevalence of smoking among peers, parent support and academic involvement.</p>
<p>They found, in their study <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/12/09/peds.2014-0760.abstract" target="_blank">published in the journal <em>Pediatrics</em></a>, that about 17% of the high schoolers smoked e-cigarettes only, 12% smoked both e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes, 3% only smoked conventional cigarettes, and 68% said they did not smoke.</p>
<p><strong>MORE: </strong><a title="Debate Over E-Cigs Lights Up" href="http://time.com/3274245/e-cigarettes-debate/" target="_blank">Debate Over E-Cigs Lights Up</a></p>
<p>Students who smoked tobacco cigarettes, or who smoked both cigarettes and e-cigs, fell within the highest risk category for picking up the habit. E-cigarette users were lower on the risk threshold than those two groups, suggesting it&#8217;s attracting young people who wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be interested in conventional smoking. E-cigarette users and dual smokers were also more likely that nonsmokers to believe e-cigarettes are healthier than regular cigarettes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that e-cigarette only users were intermediate in risk status between nonusers and dual users raises the possibility that e-cigarettes are recruiting medium-risk adolescents, who otherwise would be less susceptible to tobacco product use,&#8221; the authors write.</p>
<p>Part of this perception and attraction to e-cigs could be the fact that they are heavily marketed in public places the authors suggest.</p>
<p><strong>MORE: </strong><a title=" In Children&rsquo;s Hands, E-Cigarettes Can Be Deadly" href="http://time.com/47754/in-the-hands-of-babes-e-cigarettes-can-be-deadly/" target="_blank">In Children&rsquo;s Hands, E-Cigarettes Can Be Deadly</a></p>
<p>The trouble with e-cigs is that there&#8217;s still not enough research to make any definitive conclusions on their risks or benefits. Some experts <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/09/07/e-cigarettes-as-effective-as-nicotine-patches-in-smoking-cessation/" target="_blank">argue</a> that since e-cigarettes have fewer unhealthy components than traditional cigarettes, they are a better option. They have even been trumpeted as a possible quitting device. Other experts argue that e-cigarettes are just another gateway to nicotine use, and are therefore unacceptable. Whether young people can access them and get hooked is of great concern.</p>
<p>Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only regulates e-cigarettes marketed for therapeutic purposes, and many products continue to be marketed and sold with little FDA interference. The agency has proposed a rule that would give it more regulatory power over e-cigarettes that would look similar to other tobacco products, but nothing has been finalized. The FDA has also <a href="http://time.com/75312/fda-e-cigarettes/" target="_blank">suggested a ban</a> on sale of e-cigs to minors. The agency <a href="http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/publichealthfocus/ucm172906.htm" target="_blank">admits</a> there&#8217;s a lot that consumers don&#8217;t know about e-cigs, like if they lead young people to smoke other tobacco products or how much nicotine is actually inhaled in each use.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3633431"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

E-cigarette users were lower on the risk threshold than those two groups, suggesting it&#8217;s attracting young people who wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be interested in conventional smoking. E-cigarette users and dual smokers were also more likely that nonsmokers to believe e-cigarettes are healthier than regular cigarettes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The fact that e-cigarette only users were intermediate in risk status between nonusers and dual users raises the possibility that e-cigarettes are recruiting medium-risk adolescents, who otherwise would be less susceptible to tobacco product use,&#8221; the authors write.<\/p>\n<p>Part of this perception and attraction to e-cigs could be the fact that they are heavily marketed in public places the authors suggest.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE: <\/strong><a title=\" In Children&rsquo;s Hands, E-Cigarettes Can Be Deadly\" href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/47754\/in-the-hands-of-babes-e-cigarettes-can-be-deadly\/\" target=\"_blank\">In Children&rsquo;s Hands, E-Cigarettes Can Be Deadly<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The trouble with e-cigs is that there&#8217;s still not enough research to make any definitive conclusions on their risks or benefits. Some experts <a href=\"http:\/\/healthland.time.com\/2013\/09\/07\/e-cigarettes-as-effective-as-nicotine-patches-in-smoking-cessation\/\" target=\"_blank\">argue<\/a> that since e-cigarettes have fewer unhealthy components than traditional cigarettes, they are a better option. They have even been trumpeted as a possible quitting device. Other experts argue that e-cigarettes are just another gateway to nicotine use, and are therefore unacceptable. Whether young people can access them and get hooked is of great concern.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only regulates e-cigarettes marketed for therapeutic purposes, and many products continue to be marketed and sold with little FDA interference. The agency has proposed a rule that would give it more regulatory power over e-cigarettes that would look similar to other tobacco products, but nothing has been finalized. The FDA has also <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/75312\/fda-e-cigarettes\/\" target=\"_blank\">suggested a ban<\/a> on sale of e-cigs to minors. The agency <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/newsevents\/publichealthfocus\/ucm172906.htm\" target=\"_blank\">admits<\/a> there&#8217;s a lot that consumers don&#8217;t know about e-cigs, like if they lead young people to smoke other tobacco products or how much nicotine is actually inhaled in each use.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\"

A chaotic scene unfolded as police raided the cafe, with hostages running outside and an officer carrying out at least one ailing hostage.<\/p>\n<p>New South Wales Premier Mike Baird said the gunman had carried out &#8220;horrendous vicious attacks.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are a peaceful society which is the envy of the world,&#8221; he said in a televised news conference. &#8220;Today we must come together like never before.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Two hostages died, five escaped and six were uninjured, police said. At least one police officer suffered a minor gunshot wound to the face, but was alive. Police wouldn&#8217;t say whether the hostages were killed by the gunman or in crossfire during the raid, the Associated Press reports.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They believed if they didn&#8217;t enter there would have been many more lives lost,&#8221; New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said of the officers&#8217; decision to raid the cafe. &#8220;Events that were unfolding inside of the premises led them to the belief that now was the time to deploy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It started Monday morning, when hostages were seen displaying a black and white flag in the window of the Lindt caf&eacute; in Martin Place&mdash;a major commercial precinct usually crowded with office workers and tourists and, at this time of year, Christmas shoppers.<\/p>\n<p>The flag bore, in Arabic text, what was thought to be the s<em>hahada<\/em>, or Muslim testimony of faith. The flag, which is commonly flown by Islamist terrorist groups, sparked fears that a terrorist attack was unfolding. But Sydney police had not said if it is a terrorist attack, and an official later described it as an &#8220;isolated incident.&#8221; Authorities confirmed earlier they had made contact with the perpetrator and were in negotiations. Several hostages had left the scene late Monday before the chaos that unfolded early Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. President Barack Obama was briefed overnight on the crisis.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is a very disturbing incident,&rdquo; Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in a televised address earlier Monday. &ldquo;It is profoundly shocking that innocent people should be held hostage by an armed person claiming political motivation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&ldquo;We are a free, open and generous people, and today we have responded to this in character,&rdquo; he added.&ldquo;Yes, it has been a difficult day. Yes, it has been a day which has tested us, but so far, like Australians in all sorts of situations, we have risen to the challenge.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Australia&#8217;s paramount figure on Islamic law, the Grand Mufti Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, issued a statement &#8220;unequivocally&#8221; condemning the action. He said the Muslim community was &#8220;devastated&#8221; by the incident and said such actions are &#8220;denounced in part and in whole in Islam.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Buildings in the area, including the famed Sydney Opera House and the U.S. consulate, had been evacuated, with office workers taken to nearby Hyde Park. Martin Place train station, one of Sydney&#8217;s busiest, was closed, as were major nearby roads.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes here in Australia you think something like this would never happen so it&rsquo;s pretty shocking to see,&#8221; said Kristina Ryan, who works nearby at Circular Quay. &#8220;It&rsquo;s been really frustrating with the lack of information and how much longer can they expect us to just sit here without understanding why this is happening? I think that&rsquo;s really adding to the fear people are feeling in the city.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ryan said that fear was amplified as she and her co-workers watched as authorities evacuated the Opera House.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;There are lots of government buildings around. It&rsquo;s a very busy place, especially on a Monday morning,&rdquo; Clarke Jones, a terrorism expert at Australian National University&rsquo;s College of Asia and the Pacific, tells TIME.<\/p>\n<p>The unfolding hostage crisis comes more than two months after Australian authorities foiled a terrorist plot by local ISIS supporters, who were reportedly planning to behead members of the public in Martin Place.<\/p>\n<p>Days later, on Sept. 21, forces affiliated with the ISIS <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3395356\/australia-isis-asio-terrorism-raids-omarjan-azari-sydney-brisbane\/\">released<\/a> a 42-minute audio recording calling on followers to attack non-Muslims in Australia. The call to arms appears to have been made in retaliation for Canberra&#8217;s deployment of military personnel and fighter jets to the Middle East to fight in the international coalition against ISIS and al-Qaeda-affiliated groups in Syria and Iraq.<\/p>\n<p>According to Jones, officials believe that up to 60 Australian nationals and residents are believed to be currently <a href=\"http:\/\/world.time.com\/2013\/07\/16\/gday-damascus-australians-are-joining-syrias-rebels-in-surprising-numbers\/\" target=\"_blank\">fighting in jihadist ranks<\/a> in the Middle East. Dozens are believed to have already returned to Australia.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t been prosecuted, but we don&rsquo;t know at this stage if they&rsquo;ve come back with an added intent to continue the fight here in Australia,&rdquo; says Jones. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to know.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>As darkness fell on Monday evening, a crowd of around 200 people remained milling around the scene. &#8220;Everyone was quite calm,&#8221; says Victor Domni, who works at Macquarie Bank directly across from the Lindt cafe and was among the first to be evacuated this morning. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t in a position to do anymore work so I was ready to go home. I&#8217;m quite hesitant to go into work tomorrow because it&#8217;s quite scary.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen this on the news happening in other places and it&#8217;s finally hit home so it&#8217;s a bit shocking,&#8221; he adds.<\/div>\n<p>Abbott urged his fellow Australians to remain coolheaded.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves. Australia is a peaceful, open and generous society,&rdquo; he said on Monday morning. &ldquo;Nothing should ever change that.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><em>-Additional reporting by Courtney Subramanian \/ Sydney<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3633700\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p><em>Read next: <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3633380\/sydney-hostage-siege-illridewithyou-australia\/?xid=time_readnext\" target=\"_blank\">Australians Use #IllRideWithYou Hashtag in Solidarity With Muslims During Sydney Siege<\/a><\/em><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3633134\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=3%20Dead%20After%20Police%20Storm%20Sydney%20Cafe%20to%20End%20Hostage%20Crisis%20%7C%20TIME&body=3%20Dead%20After%20Police%20Storm%20Sydney%20Cafe%20to%20End%20Hostage%20Crisis%0A%0AHours-long%20standoff%20ends%20in%20chaotic%20scene%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3633134%2Fsydney-hostage-martin-place-lindt-cafe-terrorism%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3633134%2Fsydney-hostage-martin-place-lindt-cafe-terrorism%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-ff8W&text=3%20dead%20after%20police%20storm%20Sydney%20cafe%20to%20end%20hostage%20crisis&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3633134%2Fsydney-hostage-martin-place-lindt-cafe-terrorism%2F&title=3+Dead+After+Police+Storm+Sydney+Cafe+to+End+Hostage+Crisis\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3633134\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3633134\/sydney-hostage-martin-place-lindt-cafe-terrorism\/\" data-title=\"3 Dead After Police Storm Sydney Cafe to End Hostage Crisis\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more","world":true},"tag":{"name":"Australia","slug":"australia","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/australia\/"},"tags":"Australia|cafe|hostages|Islamism|Lindt Cafe|Martin Place|sydney|sydney hostage situation|Terrorism","hero":{"class":"landscape","mini":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/sydney-seige-hostage-crisis.jpg?crop=555px%2C320px%2C1168px%2C1168px&resize=74%2C74","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/sydney-seige-hostage-crisis.jpg?crop=555px%2C320px%2C1168px%2C1168px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/sydney-seige-hostage-crisis.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/sydney-seige-hostage-crisis.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/sydney-seige-hostage-crisis.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/sydney-seige-hostage-crisis.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Rob Griffith\u2014AP","caption":"A hostage runs to armed tactical response police officers for safety after she escaped from a cafe under siege at Martin Place in the central business district of Sydney on Dec. 15, 2014.

On average, people in the study, published in the journal <i>JAMA Internal Medicine<\/i>, felt closer to 56.8. Among the participants, 69.6% said their self-perceived age was three or more years younger than their chronological age, 25.6% said they felt their age or close to it, and only 4.8% felt older than they actually were.<\/p>\n<p>When the researchers compared the self-perceived ages to death rates, they found that rates were lower among those who felt younger, compared to participants who felt their age or older.<\/p>\n<p>Of course unrelated factors like disabilities and overall health played a role, but when the researchers adjusted for those factors, they still noted a 41% greater mortality risk for the people who said they felt old.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s driving this apparent phenomenon needs further assessment, but the authors suggested that people who feel younger may have greater resilience and will to live. &#8220;Self-perceived age has the potential to change, so interventions may be possible,&#8221; the authors write. &#8220;Individuals who feel older than their actual age could be targeted with health messages promoting positive health behaviors and attitudes toward aging,&#8221; the study concluded.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\"

She said all of the victims had a &#8220;familial relationship&#8221; to Stone.<\/p>\n<p>On Monday afternoon, police converged on a home in Pennsburg, about 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and used a megaphone to try to compel an end to their daylong pursuit of Stone.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Bradley, this is the police department!&#8221; an officer yelled. &#8220;Come to the front door with your hands up.

Weron told the Lansdale Reporter the couple had been fighting over custody of children.<\/p>\n<p>Police with armored vehicles and rifles flocked to Pennsburg after spending several hours at the Souderton home where several victims were found.<\/p>\n<p>Several school districts ordered students and teachers to shelter in place. The Souderton Area School District, citing police activity in Souderton and Harleysville, lifted the order after about two hours but said officials were monitoring the situation.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3634348\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=6%20Dead%2C%20Suspect%20on%20Loose%20in%20Suburban%20Philadelphia%20%7C%20TIME&body=6%20Dead%2C%20Suspect%20on%20Loose%20in%20Suburban%20Philadelphia%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3634348%2Fsuburban-philadelphia-shooting-bradley-william-stone%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3634348%2Fsuburban-philadelphia-shooting-bradley-william-stone%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-ffsw&text=6%20dead%2C%20suspect%20on%20loose%20in%20suburban%20Philadelphia&via=TIME\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3634348%2Fsuburban-philadelphia-shooting-bradley-william-stone%2F&title=6+Dead%2C+Suspect+on+Loose+in+Suburban+Philadelphia\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3634348\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3634348\/suburban-philadelphia-shooting-bradley-william-stone\/\" data-title=\"6 Dead, Suspect on Loose in Suburban Philadelphia\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"U.S.","slug":"us","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/us\/","description":"The latest news and analysis on crime, religion, education, transportation, weather, immigration, sports, drugs, the law, and other news from around the nation","us":true},"tag":{"name":"Crime","slug":"crime","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/crime\/"},"tags":"Crime","hero":{"class":"landscape","mini":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/shooter-stone-penn.jpg?crop=202px%2C449px%2C1856px%2C1855px&resize=74%2C74","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/shooter-stone-penn.jpg?crop=202px%2C449px%2C1856px%2C1855px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/shooter-stone-penn.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/shooter-stone-penn.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/shooter-stone-penn.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/shooter-stone-penn.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Matt Rourke\u2014AP","caption":"A police officer moves near a home on Dec. 15, 2014, in Souderton, Pa. where a suspect is believed to have barricaded himself inside after shootings at multiple homes.

Henderson, a former league employee for nearly two decades, called Peterson&#8217;s domestic abuse case &#8220;arguably one of the most egregious cases of domestic violence&#8221; under Goodell&#8217;s nine-year tenure as commissioner.<\/p>\n<p>Peterson was suspended for the season in November after he was indicted on felony charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child in September. He pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault on Nov. 4 after authorities claimed he hit his 4-year-old son with a switch.<\/p>\n<p>Peterson cannot be reinstated before April 15, 2015.<\/p>\n<p>After Henderson&#8217;s decision was handed down, the NFLPA responded in a statement:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The NFLPA expected this outcome, given the hearing officer&#8217;s relationship and financial ties to the NFL. The decision itself ignores the facts, the evidence and the collective bargaining agreement. This decision also represents the NFL&#8217;s repeated failure to adhere to due process and confirms its inconsistent treatment of players. Our union is considering immediate legal remedies.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>At the hearing last week, the union argued that Peterson was punished retroactively under Goodell&#8217;s changes to the personal conduct policy in August. It also said Peterson was subjected to a &#8220;new and obfuscated disciplinary process,&#8221; according to <em>USA TODAY<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Henderson <a href=\"http:\/\/stmedia.startribune.com\/documents\/10petersondoc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">rejected<\/a> those claims in his ruling:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I conclude that the player has not demonstrated that the process and procedures surrounding his discipline were not fair and consistent; he was afforded all the protections and rights to which he is entitled, and I find no basis to vacate or reduce the discipline.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Henderson also echoed Goodell&#8217;s claims in a letter to Peterson that the Vikings star failed to &#8220;reflect remorse or appreciation for the seriousness of his actions.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.si.com\/nfl\/2014\/12\/15\/adrian-peterson-lawsuit-nfl\" target=\"_blank\"><em>This article originally appeared on SI.com<\/em><\/a><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3633748\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Players%20File%20Lawsuit%20Against%20NFL%20Over%20Adrian%20Peterson%20%7C%20TIME&body=Players%20File%20Lawsuit%20Against%20NFL%20Over%20Adrian%20Peterson%0A%0ANFL%20Players%20Association%20argues%20against%20NFL%27s%20decision%20to%20suspend%20the%20Vikings%20running%20back%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3633748%2Funion-lawsuit-nfl-adrian-peterson%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3633748%2Funion-lawsuit-nfl-adrian-peterson%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-ffiQ&text=Players%20file%20lawsuit%20against%20NFL%20over%20Adrian%20Peterson&via=TIME\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3633748%2Funion-lawsuit-nfl-adrian-peterson%2F&title=Players+File+Lawsuit+Against+NFL+Over+Adrian+Peterson\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3633748\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3633748\/union-lawsuit-nfl-adrian-peterson\/\" data-title=\"Players File Lawsuit Against NFL Over Adrian Peterson\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Sports","slug":"sports","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/sports\/","description":"Where sports is on the mind.

Some ended up out of pocket to the tune of up to $30,000.<\/p>\n<p>The incident was down to a problem with a software tool developed by Derry-based RepricerExpress, which allows businesses to offer their goods on Amazon.co.uk.<\/p>\n<p>The software automatically changes prices for the items on sale to guarantee that they stay competitive, but in this instance, it generated a self-reinforcing loop in which goods were automatically re-priced down to a penny.<\/p>\n<p>One user <a href=\"https:\/\/sellercentral.amazon.com\/forums\/thread.jspa?threadID=233458\" target=\"_blank\">complained on an Amazon bulletin board<\/a> that stock worth $15,000 had been sold in this fashion within 40 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Being they are not based in the US (sic) It takes away lots of options for us to recoup our loses,&rdquo; the user wrote. &ldquo;Last night I had to explain to my wife and 3, 4 and 5 year old that we could not take our trip to Disney in February.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cityam.com\/205643\/amazon-glitch-sparks-outrage\" target=\"_blank\">City AM<\/a> cited one fancy dress company owner as saying her company had lost over $30,000 overnight.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon said it was unable to cancel orders that had been dispatched and charged to customers, but another user on the bulletin board noted that it had been able to cancel those that weren&rsquo;t slated for urgent shipping.<\/p>\n<p>RepricerExpress chief executive Brendan Doherty said on the company&rsquo;s website he was &ldquo;truly sorry for the distress this has caused our customers,&rdquo; and said Amazon had reassured him that sellers&rsquo; accounts wouldn&rsquo;t be penalized as a result.<\/p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t clear what degree of compensation would be available to the businesses that had suffered.

Only one of the new songs, &#8220;Back in the Future (Part 1),&#8221; appears to address his absence in any significant detail. Its lyrics reference &#8220;friends who turn their backs on you \/ reminiscing over what you&#8217;ve been missing&#8221; as well as his famous &#8220;Untitled (How Does It Feel)&#8221; music video, in which the singer appeared naked, filmed from the waist up: &#8220;I been wondering if I can ever again \/ So if you&#8217;re wondering about the shape I&#8217;m in \/ I hope it ain&#8217;t my abdomen that you&#8217;re referring to.&#8221; As D&#8217;Angelo&#8217;s figure started to outshine his music, the song, &#8220;sent him spinning out of control,&#8221; former EMI executive Gary Harris told <em>GQ<\/em>.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3633069\"><\/div>\n<p>Though the first taste of the new album, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/dangelomusicofficial\/sugah-daddy\" target=\"_blank\">Sugah Daddy<\/a>,&#8221; premiered this weekend, <em>Black Messiah<\/em>&#8216;s official first single, &#8220;Really Love,&#8221; will hit radio tomorrow. Meandering and sonically dense &mdash; half of the record&#8217;s songs run more than five minutes &mdash; the album is recognizably D&#8217;Angelo even when his voice, rarely alone without layers and harmonies, experiments with different voices and twists itself into an almost cartoonish falsetto. Its rich sound, featuring notable guitar work from D&#8217;Angelo, can be attributed to its old-school analog origins &mdash; Grammy Award&ndash;winning engineer Russell Elevado, who worked on both <em>Black Messiah<\/em> and <em>Voodoo<\/em>, says the album was recorded on two-inch tape and is digital-free.<\/p>\n<p>In a lyric booklet passed out at the event, D&#8217;Angelo explains the title of the record:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Black Messiah<\/em> is a hell of a name for an album. It can be misunderstood. Many will think it&#8217;s about religion. Some will jump to the conclusion that I&#8217;m calling myself a Black Messiah. For me, the title is about all of us. It&#8217;s about the world. It&#8217;s about an idea we can all aspire to. We should all aspire to be a Black Messiah.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s about people rising up in Ferguson and in Egypt and in Occupy Wall Street and in every place where a community has had enough and decides to make change happen,&#8221; D&#8217;Angelo writes in a statement about the album &#8220;It&#8217;s not about praising one charismatic leader but celebrating thousands of them. Not every song on this album is politically charged (though many are), but calling this album <em>Black Messiah<\/em> creates a landscape there these songs can live to the fullest. <em>Black Messiah<\/em> is not one man. It&#8217;s a feeling that, collectively, we are all that leader.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\"

who was already under investigation for charges of murder and sexual assault.<\/p>\n<p>A number of biographical details have since surfaced about the lone gunman, including:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. He was an Iranian emigrant<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Monis, age 50, was born in Iran and emigrated to Australia in 1996, Australia&#8217;s 9News <a href=\"http:\/\/www.9news.com.au\/national\/2014\/12\/16\/00\/48\/sydney-hostage-taker-named-as-man-monis\" target=\"_blank\">reports<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. He converted from Shiite to Sunni Islam<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>He jettisoned his birth name Manteghi Bourjerdi and rejected his religious upbringing as a Shiite muslim, favoring instead an extreme interpretation of Sunni Islam, according to a post on his website in which he refers to Shiites in a derogatory term, BBC <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-australia-30484419\" target=\"_blank\">reports<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. He dubbed himself a Sheikh<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>He adopted the alias &#8220;Sheikh Haron&#8221; and styled himself as a local &#8220;spiritual advisor.&#8221; Muslim community leaders <a href=\"http:\/\/www.9news.com.au\/national\/2014\/12\/16\/00\/48\/sydney-hostage-taker-named-as-man-monis\" target=\"_blank\">dispute<\/a> those assertions, telling Australia&#8217;s 9News that he was a largely marginalized figure &#8220;shunned&#8221; by the community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. He claimed no allegiance to terror groups<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Monis declared himself independent of any affiliations with known terrorist organizations, though he did gain a brief moment of media attention in 2009 for his strident protests against Australian troop involvement in Afghanistan. His protests included harassing the families of dead soldiers by sending offensive letters. Some Islamic blogs <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theaustralian.com.au\/national-affairs\/defence\/sheik-faked-to-stir-up-ill-feeling\/story-e6frg8yo-1111115203676?nk=be1caeb72a2e4d0b7a0f1e6151d3619e\" target=\"_blank\">nicknamed him<\/a> the &#8220;fake Sheikh,&#8221; the <em>Australian<\/em> reported in 2007.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. He was in trouble with the law<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Monis faced criminal charges for being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, whose body was found with stab wounds and burn marks in a Sydney suburb. He also was charged for allegedly committing upwards of 40 sexual assaults during his work as a &#8220;spiritual healer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The <em>Sydney Morning Herald <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/nsw\/gunman-man-haron-monis-covered-in-excrement-while-in-prison-20141215-127tyv.html\" target=\"_blank\">reports<\/a> that he had been convicted for the letter writing campaign, and that Monday&#8217;s shooting incident followed an Australian court&#8217;s decision on Friday to uphold the conviction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. He is believed to have acted alone<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Police have identified him as a &#8220;lone&#8221; actor and believe that the hostage plot began and ended with him. His independence has also raised alarms in the security establishment about the difficulty of disrupting plots that are hatched in isolation by lone radicals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7.

A rookie officer fired within 2 seconds.<\/p>\n<p>Tamir had an airsoft gun, which shoots nonlethal plastic pellets.<\/p>\n<p>Rice said she wants the officer charged with murder and she called on authorities to make sure young officers don&#8217;t &#8220;ignore the training.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Police say officers were responding to a call Nov. 22 about someone possibly carrying a gun. They say Tamir didn&#8217;t respond to commands to raise his hands before Officer Timothy Loehmann fired his weapon. The officers also meant to stop the patrol car farther from Tamir but the vehicle slid on the grass, the Cleveland police union has said.<\/p>\n<p>Rice said she found out later that Tamir was handed the fake weapon by a girl at the playground. She said police put Tamir&#8217;s 14-year-old sister in handcuffs as she rushed to help her mortally wounded brother that day.<\/p>\n<p>Rice&#8217;s attorney, Benjamin Crump, said in the AP interview that the two officers could have defused the situation &mdash; by talking to the boy from a distance instead of pulling up next to him on the grass and firing.<\/p>\n<p>An internal Cleveland police investigation is underway and the results will be turned over to the local prosecutor, who will present them to a grand jury. The fatal encounter was caught on surveillance video.<\/p>\n<p>Clutching Crump&#8217;s hand, the teary-eyed mother said Monday she knew exactly where her son had gone before the shooting. After she made lunch for him, he went to a recreation center across the street from their home then to the playground that is steps away from his school. His 14-year-old sister was with him, their mother said, &#8220;and I told them to stick together and be safe.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The sister had gone to the bathroom when she heard a shot. Meanwhile, just after 3 p.m. that day, the mother heard a knock on her door.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Two little boys came and knocked on my door and said, &#8216;The police just shot your son twice in the stomach,'&#8221; she recalled Monday.<\/p>\n<p>When she got to the scene, following her 16-year-old son, she saw him being held against the police car, with officers surrounding him while Tamir lay on the ground, she said. Tamir&#8217;s sister was in the back of the cruiser, their mother said.<\/p>\n<p>Rice said that when she tried to get close to her bleeding son, officers &#8220;pushed me back, telling me to chill out or they were going to put me in the police car.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Rice, who is black, said she long ago had &#8220;The Talk&#8221; with her children &mdash; as black parents call warnings to their children to comply with police or risk danger.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My kids already know that they are supposed to cooperate with authority, period,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>She said her son was talented in sports and the arts and was loved in their community as someone who helped others.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;All lives matter, I don&#8217;t see any color.

Crosby reportedly received a vaccination for the disease as recently as this February, according to the Penguins.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Still, <a href=\"http:\/\/regressing.deadspin.com\/why-the-nhl-lost-control-of-its-mumps-outbreak-1670727885\" target=\"_blank\">doctors<\/a> say that the effectiveness of the vaccine can wear off over time, and hockey players may be particularly susceptible to the disease given the exchange of saliva during heavy hits.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span

data-ob-template=\"timemag\"><\/div><\/aside><p>People may soon have a new option for how they want to be laid to rest, if one Seattle-area nonprofit gets its way.<\/p>\n<p>The Urban Death Project, a nonprofit group founded in 2011 by architect Katrina Spade, proposes human composting as an alternative to human burial, which requires overcrowded, unsustainable cemeteries,<a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2014\/12\/15\/us-usa-composting-seattle-idUSKBN0JT1BY20141215\" target=\"_blank\"> Reuter reports<\/a>. UDP&#8217;s plan is to build a large concrete composting facility in Seattle for human remains, peppered with places of reflection for visitors. Following a ceremony, bodies would be laid in the composting structure, and several weeks later, the remains would be enough to plant a tree or a bed of flowers.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The idea is to fold the dead back into the city,&rdquo; she told Reuters. &ldquo;The options we currently have for our bodies are lacking, both from an environmental standpoint, but also, and perhaps more importantly, from a meaning standpoint.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Composting bodies would also require no embalming, since decomposition is the goal.<\/p>\n<p>But the idea hasn&#8217;t gotten off the ground&mdash;or into the ground&mdash;quite yet. In addition to getting a funeral home license, Urban Death Project faces zoning challenges that regulate composting. And recycling human remains isn&rsquo;t an accepted mode of body disposal yet. For the project to work, Washington state law, which requires corpses to be buried, cremated, donated to science or transferred from the state, would have to change, Reuters reports.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There will be some regulatory work to do, but I&#8217;m confident,&#8221; Spade told Reuters. &#8220;People want this option.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2014\/12\/15\/us-usa-composting-seattle-idUSKBN0JT1BY20141215\" target=\"_blank\">[<em>Reuters<\/em>]<\/a><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3634733\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Seattle%20Nonprofit%20Group%20Advocates%20for%20Composting%20of%20Human%20Remains%20%7C%20TIME&body=Seattle%20Nonprofit%20Group%20Advocates%20for%20Composting%20of%20Human%20Remains%0A%0AThe%20process%20requires%20no%20toxic%20embalming%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3634733%2Fhuman-composting%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3634733%2Fhuman-composting%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-ffyJ&text=Seattle%20nonprofit%20group%20advocates%20for%20composting%20of%20human%20remains&via=TIME\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3634733%2Fhuman-composting%2F&title=Seattle+Nonprofit+Group+Advocates+for+Composting+of+Human+Remains\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3634733\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3634733\/human-composting\/\" data-title=\"Seattle Nonprofit Group Advocates for Composting of Human Remains\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"U.S.","slug":"us","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/us\/","description":"The latest news and analysis on crime, religion, education, transportation, weather, immigration, sports, drugs, the law, and other news from around the nation","us":true},"tag":{"name":"Environment","slug":"environment","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/environment\/"},"tags":"compost|composting|Environment|human composting|urban death project","id":3634733,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3634733%2Fhuman-composting%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-ffyJ","encoded_title":"Seattle+Nonprofit+Group+Advocates+for+Composting+of+Human+Remains","twitter_text":"Seattle%20nonprofit%20group%20advocates%20for%20composting%20of%20human%20remains","twitter_via":"TIME","subjects":[null],"ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"Seattle Nonprofit Group Advocates for Composting of Human Remains"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"Seattle Nonprofit Group Advocates for Composting of Human Remains"},"email_title":"Seattle%20Nonprofit%20Group%20Advocates%20for%20Composting%20of%20Human%20Remains%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Seattle%20Nonprofit%20Group%20Advocates%20for%20Composting%20of%20Human%20Remains%0A%0AThe%20process%20requires%20no%20toxic%20embalming%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3634733%2Fhuman-composting%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-outbrain|rr-ad|rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3634733\/human-composting\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3634443\/cards-against-humanity-poop-black-friday\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-ffu3","title":"Why This Company Sent Poop to 30,000 People for Black Friday","friendly_title":"Why This Company Sent Poop to 30,000 People for Black Friday","post_type":"post","available":true,"time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Why This Company Sent Poop to 30,000 People for Black Friday","excerpt":"\"Initially we got a dozen people who were really surprised it was poop, but it was just actual poop.\"","format":"video","time":{"pretty":"5:17 PM ET","published":"2014-12-15 17:17:09","updated":"2014-12-15 22:17:09","minute":"5:17 pm","short":"5:17 PM ET"},"authors":[{"id":208215499,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/laura-stampler\/","name":"Laura Stampler","bio":"Laura is a reporter at TIME.

Costing $6 a pop, the special offer was a part of the stunt-loving company&#8217;s Black Friday sale.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We all really hate Black Friday, it&rsquo;s just kind of a horrible day,&#8221; says game co-creator Max Temkin. &#8220;It comes after this day where you&rsquo;re supposed to be thankful for what you have, and then it&rsquo;s just this whole huge media spectacle of people fighting each other to save $50 on a TV.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And so Cards Against Humanity decided to create a media spectacle of its own by pulling all of its products off its site and only selling &#8220;Bullshit&#8221; &mdash; which Temkin says sold out in less than two hours. (This isn&#8217;t the company&#8217;s first stunt &mdash; for last year&#8217;s Black Friday, the game was sold for $5 above the normal price.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We also had the idea of issuing people a one penny off coupon, but that felt weird because it was still a deal,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s sort of still <em>doing<\/em> Black Friday.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But how did the makers of Cards Against Humanity get the poop in the box? &#8220;Well, we didn&#8217;t do anything that anyone else couldn&#8217;t have done,&#8221; Temkins says. &#8220;We went on Google and were like, &#8216;Can you buy bullshit? Can you sell bullshit?'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The team found a cattle ranch in Texas that sold pasteurized bull feces for shipments and understood &#8220;what we were trying to do.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Writing on the package boasts that while the box was made in China &mdash; &#8220;It&#8217;s the same manufacturer that does packaging for Apple!&#8221; Temkin says the poop was made in America.<\/p>\n<p>And now, says Temkins, &#8220;It&#8217;s sent, it&#8217;s out, it&#8217;s done&hellip; Initially we got a dozen people who were really surprised it was poop, but it was just actual poop.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/laist.com\/2014\/12\/13\/update_30000_people_really_did_buy.php\" target=\"_blank\"><em>LAist<\/em> journalists<\/a> broke the poop apart to see if there was hidden inside, only to find that it was simply feces.<\/p>\n<p>While the promotion is over, some people are even selling their &#8220;Bullshit&#8221; packages at a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ebay.com\/itm\/Cards-Against-Humanity-Bullshit-In-Hand-\/141504440881?pt=Games_US&amp;hash=item20f2526a31\" target=\"_blank\">600% markup of $36 on eBay.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Cards Against Humanity made 20 cents on each $6 box of holiday bullshit.

While the LRA had forced thousands of children to become child soldiers over the previous two decades, by the the time the film was released, Kony had been expelled from Uganda and led only a few hundred followers.<\/p>\n<p>The film&#8217;s backlash appeared to have hurt the NGO&#8217;s fundraising efforts: while Invisible Children raised $26.5 million in 2012, nearly as much as it had raised in the previous three years combined, it collected $4.9 million in 2013, according to its <a href=\"http:\/\/invisiblechildren.com\/financials\/\" target=\"_blank\">financial reports<\/a>.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3634552\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=The%20Group%20Behind%20Kony%202012%20Is%20Shutting%20Down%20Most%20Operations%20%7C%20TIME&body=The%20Group%20Behind%20Kony%202012%20Is%20Shutting%20Down%20Most%20Operations%0A%0A%22Despite%20making%20incredible%20progress%20toward%20our%20mission%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20been%20difficult%20to%20fund%20the%20breadth%20of%20our%20work%2C%20especially%20over%20the%20last%20two%20years%22%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3634552%2Fkony-2012-shut-down-invisible-children%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3634552%2Fkony-2012-shut-down-invisible-children%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-ffvO&text=The%20Group%20Behind%20Kony%202012%20Is%20Shutting%20Down%20Most%20Operations&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3634552%2Fkony-2012-shut-down-invisible-children%2F&title=The+Group+Behind+Kony+2012+Is+Shutting+Down+Most+Operations\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3634552\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3634552\/kony-2012-shut-down-invisible-children\/\" data-title=\"The Group Behind &lt;i&gt;Kony 2012&lt;\/i&gt; Is Shutting Down Most Operations\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more","world":true},"tag":{"name":"Uganda","slug":"uganda","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/uganda\/"},"tags":"Invisible Children|Joseph Kony|Kony 2012|Lord\\'s Resistance Army|NGO|non-profit|Scandal|Uganda","hero":{"class":"landscape","mini":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/71037986.jpg?w=74&h=74&crop=1","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/71037986.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/71037986.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/71037986.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/71037986.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/71037986.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"STRINGER\u2014AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"This picture, made available 24 May 2006 by the Monitor media group in Kampala, Uganda, shows one of the world's most wanted rebel chiefs, Joseph Kony of the Lord Resistance Movement.
