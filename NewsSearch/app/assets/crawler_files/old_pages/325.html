          <h1>About Google News</h1>
          <div class="content">

 <p>Google News is a computer-generated news site that aggregates 
			headlines from news sources worldwide, groups 
			similar stories together and displays them according to each reader's personalized
			interests.</p>
		
        <p>Traditionally, news readers first pick a publication and then look for headlines
            that interest them. We do things a little differently, with the goal of offering our readers
            more personalized options and a wider variety of perspectives from which to choose. On Google News we 
			offer links to several articles on every story, so you can first decide what subject interests
            you and then select which publishers’ accounts of each story you’d like to read. Click on
            the headline that interests you and you'll go directly to the site which published that story.</p>
        
		<p>Our articles are selected and ranked by computers that evaluate,
			among other things, how often and on what sites a story appears
			online. We also rank based on certain characteristics of news content such as freshness, location, relevance and diversity. As a result, stories are sorted without regard to political
			viewpoint or ideology and you can choose from a wide variety of
			perspectives on any given story. We'll continue to improve Google News
			by adding sources, 
			fine-tuning our technology and providing Google News to readers in even 
			<a href="http://www.google.com/support/news/bin/answer.py?answer=40237&topic=8851">more
			regions</a>.</p>
