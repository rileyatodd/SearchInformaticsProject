      </p>
      <h2>
        1. Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Applicable Terms.</strong> Thanks for using Google Play. Google Play is a service
        provided by Google Inc. (<strong>“Google”</strong>, <strong>“we”</strong> or
        <strong>“us”</strong>), located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View California
        94043, USA, and is subject to the <a href="//www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/">Google
        Terms of Service</a> (<strong>"Google ToS"</strong>). Google Play is a
        <strong>“Service”</strong> as defined in the Google ToS, and these Google Play Terms of
        Service are additional terms which apply to the use of Google Play. Your use of Google Play
        and the digital content available on it is subject to these Google Play Terms of Service
        and the Google ToS (which together we refer to as the <strong>“Terms”</strong>). Separate
        terms <a href="//play.google.com/../about/device-terms.html">here</a> apply to sales of
        devices from the Google Play store (where available).
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is any conflict between the Google Play Terms of Service and the Google ToS, the
        Google Play Terms of Service shall prevail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your use of the Google Play store requires that you agree to the following terms. Please
        read them carefully. If you do not understand the Terms, or do not accept any part of them,
        then you should not use the Google Play store.
      </p>
      <h2>
        2. Provision of Google Play
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Direct, Agency and App Sales</strong>. When you buy Content (defined as data files,
        applications, written text, mobile device software, music, audio files or other sounds,
        photographs, videos or other images) on Google Play you will buy it either:
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) directly from Google (a <strong>“Direct Sale”</strong>);
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) from the provider of the Content (the <strong>“Provider”</strong>), where Google is
        acting as an agent for the Provider (an <strong>“Agency Sale”</strong>); or
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) in the case of Android apps, from the Provider of the app (an <strong>“App
        Sale”</strong>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Each time that you purchase Content, you enter into a separate sale contract:
      </p>
      <p>
        (d) based on the Terms (as applicable) with Google (in the case of a Direct Sale);
      </p>
      <p>
        (e) based on the Terms (as applicable) with the Provider of the Content you have purchased
        (in the case of Agency Sales); or
      </p>
      <p>
        (f) with the Provider of the Content you have purchased (in the case of App Sales).
      </p>
      <p>
        The separate sale contract in (e) or (f) above (as applicable) is in addition to your
        contract with Google Inc. for the use of the Service (i.e. these Google Play Terms of
        Service).
      </p>
      <p>
        For Agency Sales the statement, in the Google ToS, that the Google ToS “do not create any
        third party beneficiary rights”, does not apply to your use of the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Access to Content.</strong> You may use Google Play to browse, locate, and/or
        download Content) for your mobile, computer or other supported device
        (<strong>“Device”</strong>). The availability of Content will vary between countries and
        not all Content may be available in your country. Some of this Content may be offered by
        Google while others may be made available by third-parties not affiliated with Google.
        Google is not responsible for any Content on Google Play that originates from a source
        other than Google and does not endorse such content.
      </p>
      <h2>
        3. Your Use of Google Play
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Age Restrictions.</strong> In order to use Google Play you must be 13 years of age
        or older. If you are 13 or older but under 18 years of age, you must have your parent or
        legal guardian’s permission to use Google Play and to accept the Terms. You must not access
        Google Play if you are a person who is either barred or otherwise legally prohibited from
        receiving or using the Service or any Content under the laws of the country in which you
        are resident or from which you access or use Google Play. You must comply with any
        additional age restrictions that might apply for the use of specific Content on Google
        Play.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Basic Use Requirements.</strong> To use the Service, you will need a Device that
        meets the system and compatibility requirements for the relevant Content, which may change
        from time to time, working Internet access, and compatible software. Your ability to use
        the Service and the performance of the Service may be affected by these factors. Such
        system requirements are your responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Third-Party Fees.</strong> You may incur access or data fees from third parties
        (such as your Internet provider or mobile carrier) in connection with your use of Content
        and Google Play. For instance, you may incur such fees if you use services provided through
        Google Play on or through third-party services or devices. You are responsible for all such
        fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Updates.</strong> You may need to install updates to Google Play or related Google
        software that we introduce from time to time to use Google Play and to access or download
        Content. Content originating from Google may communicate with Google servers from time to
        time to check for available updates to the Content and to the functionality of Google Play,
        such as bug fixes, patches, enhanced functions, missing plug-ins and new versions
        (collectively, <strong>"Updates"</strong>). Your use of the Content you have installed
        requires that you have agreed to receive such automatically requested Updates. If you do
        not agree to such automatically requested and received Updates then please do not use the
        Google Play store or install this Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Information about You.</strong> In order to access certain services or Content on
        Google Play, you may be required to provide information about yourself such as your name,
        address, and billing details. The information we collect, including information obtained
        from third parties, is shared between Google and its group companies to operate the
        Service. Google’s <a href="//www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">privacy policies</a>
        explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when using Google Play.
        Any such information you provide to Google must always be accurate, correct and up to date.
        Google may need to provide your personal information, such as your name and email address,
        to Providers for the purposes of processing your transactions and/or provisioning Content
        to you. Google has agreed with Providers that they will use this information in accordance
        with their privacy policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Unauthorised Access to Accounts.</strong> You must keep your user details secure
        and must not share them with anyone else. You must not collect or harvest any personal data
        of any user of Google Play or of any user of other Google Services via Google Play,
        including account names.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Disabled Accounts.</strong> If Google disables access to your account in accordance
        with the Terms (for example if you violate the Terms), you may be prevented from accessing
        Google Play, your account details or any files or other Content that is stored with your
        account. Please see section 6 below for your rights where you are not able to download
        Content before your account is disabled.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Malware protection.</strong> To protect you against the effects of malicious third
        party software, if you download and attempt to install an Android app onto a Device, the
        Device may send information about the app and its source to Google. Google will use the
        information to compare against a database of known malware to determine if the app is
        harmful or likely to be unsafe. Google may warn you if it considers the app to be unsafe,
        or block its installation on your device if it is known to Google to be harmful to devices,
        data or users. As part of this service, and to make it more effective, Google may also
        receive information, such as your Device ID, IP address, URL visited and one or more
        cookies. You can always choose to disable this malware protection by going to Settlings
        &gt; Security on your device.
      </p>
      <h2>
        4. Purchases and Payments.
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Free Content.</strong> Google may allow you to download or use Content free of
        charge. Any terms and conditions that apply to purchased Content will apply to free
        Content, except with respect to payment-related matters (for example, the refund-related
        provisions of these terms do not apply to such free Content). Google may impose limitations
        on your access and use of certain free Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Purchase of Content.</strong> Your contract for the purchase and use of Content is
        completed once you receive the email from Google confirming your purchase of that Content,
        and performance of this contract begins as soon as the purchase is complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Google Wallet.</strong> In order to purchase Content on Google Play, you must agree
        to the payment terms as specified in the Google Wallet <a href=
        "//wallet.google.com/customer/tos/viewdocument.html?family=0.buyertos&amp;gl=US">Terms of
        Service</a>. If you do not have a Google Wallet Account, you can set one up by going to
        <a href="//wallet.google.com/">this link</a>, where you can also find more information
        about Google Wallet. The Wallet Terms of Service and <a href=
        "//wallet.google.com/files/privacy.html?hl=en">Privacy Notice</a> also apply whenever you
        want to purchase Content using Google Wallet. Please ensure that you read those terms
        carefully before making any purchase. Some purchases in Google Play will require you to
        transact with the product Provider directly. In these cases, to process your transaction
        and maintain your account, we may share your personal information with the product
        Provider, as permitted under the Wallet Privacy Notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Other Payment Processing Methods.</strong> Google may make available to you various
        payment processing methods in addition to Google Wallet to facilitate the purchase of
        Content on Google Play. You must abide by any relevant terms and conditions or other legal
        agreement, whether with Google or a third party, that governs your use of a given payment
        processing method. Google may add or remove payment processing methods at its sole
        discretion and without notice to you. Once your purchase is complete, Google or Google’s
        payment processor may charge your credit card or other form of payment that you indicate
        for any Content ordered, along with any additional applicable amounts (including any
        taxes). You are solely responsible for all amounts payable associated with purchases you
        make on Google Play.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Eligibility for Carrier Billing.</strong> In order to determine your eligibility to
        have purchases of Content that you make through your mobile Devices billed to your mobile
        network provider’s account, when you create a Google Play account on a Device we will send
        identifiers of your Device, subscriber ID and SIM card serial number to your network
        provider. To permit this you will need to accept the network provider’s terms of service.
        The network provider may send us your billing address information to help us create your
        Google Play account. We will hold and use this information in accordance with Google’s
        <a href="//www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">Privacy Policies</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pricing.</strong> Pricing and availability of all Content displayed on Google Play
        are subject to change at any time before you click the button indicating that you want to
        purchase Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Taxes.</strong> You are responsible for any Taxes, and must pay for Content without
        any reduction for Taxes. If the seller of Content is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the
        Taxes will be charged to you. <strong>"Taxes"</strong> means any duties, customs fees, or
        taxes (other than income tax) associated with the sale of Content, including any related
        penalties or interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Compliance with Tax Laws.</strong> You must comply with any and all applicable tax
        laws, including the reporting and payment of any taxes arising in connection with your use
        of Google Play or the purchase of Content through Google Play. &nbsp;The reporting and
        payment of any such applicable taxes are your responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>All Sales Final.</strong> Except as expressly set forth in the Terms or Google’s
        refund policies displayed in the Service, all sales are final, and no returns, replacements
        or refunds are permitted. If a replacement, return or refund is granted for any
        transaction, the transaction may be reversed, and you may no longer be able to access the
        Content that you acquired through that transaction. Your rights to withdraw, cancel or
        return purchases and get a refund are set out in the additional terms for the relevant
        Content type set out below and the refund policies displayed in the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pre-orders.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) When you place a&nbsp;pre-order for a Product, your contract for the purchase and use
        of that item is completed when the Product becomes available in your account and you will
        be charged for the purchase at that time. You can cancel your&nbsp;pre-order at any time up
        to the point at which the Product becomes available to you (if you want to cancel
        the&nbsp;pre-order you will be able to do so by visiting the “My Orders” page and following
        the instructions there).
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) After the moment when the Product becomes available to you, you will not able to
        withdraw or cancel the pre-order and your cancellation and return rights are the same as
        for other Products that you purchase through Google Play. Please see the terms below for
        more information.
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) We will need to cancel your&nbsp;pre-order if the Product is withdrawn from sale in the
        store before it is made available and we reserve the right to cancel your order in the
        event the price changes before your order is fulfilled.
      </p>
      <h2>
        5. Subscriptions.
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Trials of Magazines News Content and Music.</strong> Subscribing to a free trial
        for a magazine or new content on Google Play Newsstand or for music (including as part of
        your purchase of a subscription for a magazine or music) gives you access to the
        subscription benefits for that magazine for free for a specified trial period. At the end
        of such trial period, you will be charged the price of the first period of the subscription
        and will continue to be charged until you cancel your subscription. <strong>To avoid being
        charged, you must cancel before the end of the trial period.</strong> If you cancel during
        the trial period you will retain access to the magazine issues that you access during a
        free trial period, but you will not retain access to news content or Music Subscription
        Content (as defined below) that you access during a free trial period unless you become a
        paid subscriber. Access to free trials may be limited to a certain number of free trials
        for each user during a given period. To avoid any charges, you must cancel before the end
        of the trial period; for more information on cancelling subscriptions, see the section
        titled ”Cancellations” below in this section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Trials of Apps.</strong> Subscribing to a trial for an Android app gives you access
        to the subscription benefits for that app for free for a duration specified by the
        application developer. At the end of the trial period, you will be charged the price of the
        first period of the subscription and will continue to be charged until you cancel your
        subscription. <strong>To avoid being charged, you must cancel before the end of the trial
        period.</strong> Once you cancel your trial, you will immediately lose access to the
        relevant app and any subscription privileges.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cancellations.</strong> If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription
        (whether monthly, annual or another period) to Content, you may cancel that subscription at
        any time before the end of the applicable billing cycle, and the cancellation will apply to
        the next period. &nbsp;For example, if you purchase a monthly subscription, you may cancel
        that subscription at any time during any month of the subscription, and the subscription
        will be cancelled as of the following month. &nbsp;You will not receive a refund for the
        current billing period, except in the event of a defective product (as set forth in section
        6 below), or as otherwise set forth in these Terms. With respect to magazine or news
        content subscriptions on Google Play Newsstand, you will continue to receive Content and
        updates (if applicable) of the relevant subscription during the remainder of the current
        billing period. After that billing period ends, your access to previously delivered
        magazine issues will not be affected by the cancellation, but your access to paid news
        content will terminate at the end of the billing period during which your subscription is
        cancelled. &nbsp;With respect to music subscriptions, you will continue to have access to
        Music Subscription Content (as defined in Section 5 below) during the remainder of the
        current billing period; however, your access to Music Subscription Content will terminate
        at the end of the billing period during which your subscription is cancelled. Additional
        refund policies for music and periodicals are set out in sections 7 and 10 below,
        respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Price Changes.</strong> When you purchase a subscription, you will initially be
        charged at the rate applicable at the time of your agreement to subscribe. &nbsp;If the
        price of the subscription increases later, Google will notify you. &nbsp;The increase will
        apply to the next payment due from you after the notice, provided that you have been given
        at least 10 days' prior notice before the charge is made. &nbsp;If you are given less than
        10 days' prior notice, the price increase will not apply until the payment after the next
        payment due.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Declining Price Changes.</strong> If you do not wish to pay the increased price for
        a subscription, you may cancel the subscription in the manner described in the Google Play
        <a href="//support.google.com/googleplay/?hl=en">help center</a> and you will not be
        charged further amounts for the subscription, provided you have notified us before the end
        of the current billing period. In some cases where the Provider increases the price of a
        subscription Google may cancel your subscription unless you agree to re-subscribe at the
        new price. If your subscription is cancelled and you later decide to re-subscribe, you will
        initially be charged at the then current subscription rate.
      </p>
      <h2>
        6. Rights and Restrictions
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>License to Use Content.</strong> Following payment of the applicable fees for
        Content, you will have the non-exclusive right, for the period selected by you in the case
        of a purchase for a rental period, and in other cases for as long as Google and the
        applicable copyright holder have rights to provide you that Content, to download or stream,
        in each case, solely as expressly permitted by Google via the Google Play user interface
        and subject to the restrictions set forth in the Terms and associated policies, copies of

      <p>
        <strong>No Public Performance.</strong> You must not display (in part or in whole) the
        Content as part of any public performance or display even if no fee is charged (except
        where such use would not constitute a copyright infringement or violate any other
        applicable right). Use of a tool or feature provided as an authorized part of Google Play
        (for example, “Social Recommendations”, as defined in the Music terms below) is permitted,
        provided that as you use the tool or feature as specifically permitted and only in the
        exact manner specified and enabled by Google.

        Use of any tool or feature provided as an authorized part of Google Play (for example,
        “Social Recommendations”) shall not violate this provision so long as you use the tool as
        specifically permitted and only in the exact manner specified and enabled by Google.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Capturing of Streams.</strong> You may not use Google Play or any Content in

      <p>
        <strong>Sharing.</strong> You may not use Content as part of any service for sharing,

        encourage others to circumvent, disable or defeat any of the security features or
        components, such as digital rights management software or encryption, that protect,

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Proprietary Notices.</strong> You may not remove any watermarks, labels or other
        legal or proprietary notices included in any Content, and you may not attempt to modify any

        disguising or changing any indications of the ownership or source of Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Use of Android Apps.</strong> You must use apps from Google Play in accordance with
        the Google Play Business and Program Policies which are in place from time to time, the
        current version of which can be found at <a href=

        <strong>Defective Content.</strong> Once Content is available to you through your account,
        you should check the Content as soon as reasonably possible to ensure that it downloads or
        streams correctly (as applicable) and performs as stated, and notify us as soon as
        reasonably possible if you find any errors or defect. In the case of Android apps, you
        should contact the developer concerning any defects or performance issues in the apps, as
        described in the Google Play <a href="//support.google.com/googleplay/?hl=en">help
        center</a>. In the case of Content other than apps, subject to any limitations in the
        additional terms for the specific Content below, you may cancel purchases you have made
        from Google Play to Google if Google Play does not perform as stated with respect to that
        purchased Content, and Google will provide either a replacement Content (if available) or a
        refund of the purchase price. &nbsp;If Google provides you a refund, the refund of your
        purchase price shall be your sole remedy. &nbsp; &nbsp;If Google issues a refund or credit,
        it is under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. In the case of

        for issues not received in the remaining term of subscription.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Removal or Unavailability of Content.</strong> Subject to the Terms, Content that
        you purchase will be available to you through Google Play for the period selected by you,
        in the case of a purchase for a rental period, and in other cases as long as Google has the
        right to make such content available to you. In certain cases (for example, if Google loses
        the relevant rights, discontinues a service or Content is discontinued, breaches applicable
        terms or the law), Google may remove from your Device or cease providing you with access to
        certain Content that you have purchased. &nbsp; Google will provide you with reasonable
        prior notice of any such removal or cessation. If you are not able to download a copy of
        the Content before such removal or cessation, then Google will offer you either (a) a
        replacement of the Content if possible or (b) a refund of the price of the Content.
        &nbsp;If Google issues you a refund, the refund of your purchase price shall be your sole
        remedy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Effect of Refunds.</strong> If a refund of the purchase price of Content for any
        reason is issued to you, you will no longer have the right to access the relevant Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Select, Copy and Paste.</strong> Select, copy and paste functions may be available
        for some text-based Content, and you must use these features within the prescribed limits
        and only for personal non-commercial purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Multiple Accounts.</strong> If you have multiple Google accounts with different
        user names, in some cases you may transfer Content out of an account and into another
        account, provided you are the owner of each such account and provided Google has enabled a
        feature of the relevant service allowing such transfers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limits on access on Devices.</strong> Google may from time to time place limits on
        the number of Devices and/or software applications you may use to access Content (for more
        information, please visit the Help link for the relevant Content within Google Play).
        Google may record and store the unique device identifier numbers of your Devices in order

        in the operation of nuclear facilities, life support systems, emergency communications,
        aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or any other
        such activities in which case the failure of the Services or Content could lead to death,
        personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Changes to these Terms.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Terms change, you will be asked to accept new terms before you next purchase
        Content. Once you have accepted the new terms, they will apply to your use of all Content
        (including Content you have purchased in the past) and all subsequent purchases, until we
        notify you of further changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you refuse to accept the updated terms then you will not be able to buy any further
        Content through Google Play, and the latest version of the Terms that you accepted will
        continue to apply to your use of Content. &nbsp;In this case we will, if we are able to do
        so, give you a reasonable period of time in which to download a copy of any Content you
        have previously bought from Google Play to your Device, and you may continue to view that
        copy of the Content on your Devices in accordance with the last version of the Terms that
        you accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that time has expired, you will not be given a further opportunity to download the
        Content you have previously bought and it is possible that you will no longer be able to
        use Google Play to access or use the Content you have already bought or related support
        services. If this happens, Google will offer you either a replacement of the Content, or a
        refund of the price of the Content, which will be your sole remedy.&nbsp;To access or use
        the Content you have already bought or related support services, you may also need to
        create a new account.

        7. Music on Google Play
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Introduction.</strong> Google Play includes certain music-related products and
        services, which are described in greater detail below and defined as <strong>“Music
        Products”</strong>, <strong>“Music Subscription Content”</strong> and <strong>“Music Locker
        Services”</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Music Products; Music Subscription Content.</strong> The Google Play store allows
        you to browse, preview, stream, purchase, download, recommend and use a variety of digital
        music and music-related content such as music files, music video files, previews, clips,
        artist information, user reviews, professional third-party music reviews and other digital
        content (<strong>“Music Products”</strong>). Certain Music Products may be accessible to
        you by purchasing (or receiving a free trial of) a subscription to a music subscription
        service made available via Google Play (<strong>“Music Subscription Content”</strong>).
        Music Products may be owned by Google or its third-party partners and licensors and may
        contain watermarks or other embedded data. For clarity, all Music Products constitute
        “Products” as defined in Section 1 above.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Stored Content.</strong> You can use Google Play to store digital content (such as
        music files, related metadata and album art) in Music Storage through the Music Software,
        as each is defined below (<strong>“Stored Content”</strong>). For the avoidance of doubt,
        “Music Products” do not include Stored Content. Stored Content may include both files that
        you upload directly to Music Storage and/or files that Google “scans and matches” to files
        stored locally on your Device.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Music Locker Services.</strong> Google Play may provide you with access to (a)
        server space that you can use to store music and associated data files, including Music
        Products and Stored Content (<strong>“Music Storage”</strong>) and/or (b) software
        applications (including web, desktop and mobile applications) and related services that
        allow you to upload, manage, access and play music through Music Storage (<strong>"Music
        Software"</strong>). Music Storage and Music Software are collectively referred to in these
        Terms as the “<strong>Music Locker Service</strong>”. For clarity, you may be given access
        to Stored Content and Music Subscription Content through the same user interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Use of Music Locker Services.</strong> By storing Music Products and Stored Content
        in Music Storage, you are storing a unique copy of such content and requesting Google to
        retain it on your behalf and to make it accessible to you through your Google account. By
        using the Music Locker Services, you are requesting that Google make all of the necessary
        functions and features of the Music Locker Services available to you in order to facilitate
        your use of Music Products and Stored Content. Additionally, by accessing or using Music
        Products and Stored Content through the Music Software, you are initiating and performing
        the corresponding functions on Google's servers, together with any related steps necessary
        to achieve them, through the Music Locker Services. You understand that Google, in
        performing the required technical steps at your direction to provide you with the Music
        Locker Services, may (a) transmit Music Products and Stored Content over various networks
        and in various media and (b) make such changes to Music Products and Stored Content as are
        necessary to conform and adapt it to the technical requirements of connecting networks,
        devices, services or media. You confirm and warrant to Google that you have the necessary
        rights to store in Music Storage any Stored Content that you direct Google to upload or
        store in Music Storage, and to instruct Google to perform the actions described in this
        section.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cancelling a Music Purchase; Refunds.</strong> You have the right to cancel each
        purchase of a Music Product from Google (including a music subscription) for a refund
        within 7 working days of the day after that Music Product becomes available for you to
        download or stream, provided that, with respect to music subscription free trials: (i) you
        may cancel your subscription at any time during a free trial period (as set forth in
        section 5 above) and (ii) you will not have the foregoing 7-day cancellation right once the
        paid portion of your subscription has commenced. Once you download or stream any Music
        Product that you purchase, you no longer have the right to cancel your purchase of that
        Music Product (unless the Music Product is defective). If Google grants to you a refund for
        a music subscription, the refund amount will be pro-rated to reflect remaining term of the
        subscription. Following Google’s provision of a refund to you, you will no longer have the
        right to access the applicable Music Product.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Other Google Subscription Services.</strong> You may receive access to a Google
        Play music subscription as part of a subscription to another Google product; additionally,
        you may receive access to other Google subscription products as part of a Google Play music
        subscription. The details of your access to such other Google subscription products will be
        presented to you before you complete your music subscription purchase. Your use of Google
        Play and any Google Play music subscription product is governed solely by these Terms, and
        not the terms of any other Google product, including any other Google product through which
        you receive access to a Google Play music subscription.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Social Recommendations</strong>. When you purchase Music Products, you may be given
        the opportunity to share all or a portion of the Music Products to your profile on Google+
        or other Google-approved social networks or online destinations, as determined by Google in
        its sole discretion (<strong>"Social Recommendation"</strong>). Your use of Social
        Recommendations shall be subject to the Terms and any other terms and conditions applicable
        to the social networks or online destinations to which you share such Social
        Recommendations. Google may impose limitations on your Social Recommendations. For example,
        Google may render the Music Product associated with any Social Recommendation as a
        limited-length preview rather than a full-length play.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rights to Stored Content.</strong> You retain any rights that you already hold in
        Stored Content. For the avoidance of doubt, Stored Content is not subject to the license
        grant to Google in the section of the Google Terms of Service titled “Your Content in our
        Services.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Geographic Restrictions.</strong> The Music Locker Services and Music Products are
        currently available only in some countries. You agree that you will not present any false,
        inaccurate or misleading information in an effort to misrepresent yourself as a resident of
        a supported country, and you will not attempt to circumvent any restrictions on access to
        or availability of the Music Locker Services or Music Products.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Compliance With Settings.</strong> You must observe and comply with any settings or
        parameters set by Google or a copyright holder in connection with Music Products. For
        example, Google or the copyright holders may correct errors in Music Products, add
        additional features or change the security features or regional availability of the Music
        Products. Where these changes are made, the Music Products may automatically update.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Third-Party Provisions.</strong> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these
        Terms, the third parties who license their musical or other content to Google as Music
        Products or for other use in connection with the Google Play store (including Providers in
        the case of Agency Sales) are intended third party beneficiaries under these Terms solely
        with respect to the specific provisions of these Terms that directly concern their content
        (<strong>“Third-Party Provisions”</strong>), and solely for the purpose of enabling such
        third parties to enforce their rights in such content. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
        in these Terms confers a third-party beneficiary right upon any party, with respect to any
        provision that falls outside the Third Party Provisions, which includes but is not limited
        to any provisions or agreements incorporated by reference, or that may be referenced
        without incorporation, in these Terms.

        Play, Google may provide your postal code to the magazine’s publisher. &nbsp;We also
        provide periodical publishers with sales information on periodical purchases.

        <strong>Verifying Print Subscriptions.</strong> If you are accessing a subscription on
        Google Play Newsstand through an existing print subscription from that periodical’s
