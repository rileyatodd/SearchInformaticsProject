        These Google Play Terms of Sale for Devices and any other terms referred to in these terms,
        such as terms provided in the <a href=

        "//support.google.com/googleplay/go/warranty">Warranty Center</a>
        ("<strong>Terms</strong>"), apply between you and Google Inc., a Delaware corporation whose
        principal place of business is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043,
        United States (referred to as "<strong>Google</strong>" or "<strong>we</strong>"), when you
        purchase devices and/or accessories from the Google Play store ("<strong>Device</strong>").
      </p>
      <p>
        Please carefully read these Terms. By ordering a Device, you are agreeing to these Terms.
        If you do not understand the Terms or do not accept any part of them, do not place an
        order.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Google Services
      </h3>
      <p>
        When you use any Google services through your Device, your use is subject to the applicable
        terms and conditions for those services, including the <a href=
        "//www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/">Google Terms of Service</a>. Use of certain
        Device features may require that you open a <a href="//accounts.google.com/SignUp">Google
        account</a>. Note that Google services and content may vary by region.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Google Wallet
      </h3>
      <p>
        To place an order, you must have a <a href="//www.google.com/wallet/">Google Wallet
        account</a>. You may also need to maintain a Google Wallet account to return or replace
        your Device or to receive any support offered by Google. A Google Wallet account is free
        and if you do not have one you will be directed to <a href=
        "//www.google.com/wallet/">Google Wallet</a> before you can check out. Your use of Google
        Wallet is subject to the Google Wallet Terms of Service. If you do not agree to the
        <a href="//wallet.google.com/customer/tos/viewdocument.html?family=0.buyertos&amp;gl=US">Google
        Wallet Terms of Service</a>, do not place an order.

      <h3>
        Privacy
      </h3>
      <p>
        Please refer to our <a href="//www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a>
        and the <a href="//wallet.google.com/files/privacy.html">Google Wallet Privacy Policy</a>
        for more information on how Google collects, uses and shares the information we receive
        from you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You consent that in order to process your order and to protect you and Google from
        fraudulent transactions, Google may provide your order information to reputable third
        parties to perform address verifications and to assist in fulfilling or delivering your
        order.

      <h3>
        Support
      </h3>
      <p>
        Please refer to <a href=
        "//support.google.com/googleplay/?hl=en#topic=2411735&amp;rd=2">Google Play Support</a> to
        learn more about any support offered by Google in connection with your Device. The Google
        support team will only provide support if you are located in a supported country, as
        described in the <a href=
        "//support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2462844?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2803008">Country
        Availability</a> Page.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Ordering and Payment
      </h3>
      <p>
        When you place an order for a Device on the Google Play store, you permit Google to charge
        the credit card, debit card or other payment method you have chosen for your purchase in
        the total amount of your order (including any shipping charges and taxes).
      </p>
      <p>
        Google reserves the right to reject your order. For example, Google may reject your order
        if you do not live in a country from which Devices may be purchased via the Google Play
        store or if you order more than the permitted maximum number of Devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        When your order is accepted by Google, we will send you an email which will include details
        of your order and an order number that you should refer to if you have any follow-up
        queries.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Prices and Taxes
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Device price displayed on the site does not include any shipping charges. Information
        about shipping charges can be found <a href=
        "//support.google.com/googleplay/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2411789&amp;topic=2451685&amp;ctx=topic#US">
        here</a> and will also be presented at checkout before you place your order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applicable taxes will usually be presented at checkout or on the Device description page;
        however, in some circumstances we may notify you that you are responsible for determining
        whether certain taxes apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        All prices displayed on the Google Play store are subject to change at any time without
        notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should Google reduce its price on any Device within 15 days from the date you order it, you
        must contact <a href="//support.google.com/googleplay/?hl=en#topic=2411735&amp;rd=2">Google
        Play Support</a> within 15 days of the price change to request a refund or credit for the
        difference between the price you were charged and the reduced price. Please note that this
        excludes limited-time price reductions, such as special sales events (such as Black Friday
        and Cyber Monday) and offers advertised as limited in quantity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google may also provide promotional offers or prices related to the sale of Devices. If so,
        any terms applicable to such promotional offers or prices will control in the event of a
        conflict with these Terms.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Delivery
      </h3>
      <p>
        We may not be able to deliver to all locations. Please consult our <a href=
        "//support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2462844?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2803008">Country
        Availability</a> Page for locations to which we will deliver your Device. If Google does
        not ship a Device to the address you provided, you will be sent a notice and you will not
        be charged for your order.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a Device cannot be successfully delivered because you have provided incorrect or
        incomplete delivery information, the Device will be returned to Google. In that case you
        will not be charged for the Device (or charges already incurred will be reversed using the
        initial payment method in your Google Wallet account), but you may be charged for shipping
        (and such charges will not be reversed). If a Device is not successfully delivered because
        we made a mistake, you will not be charged at all and all charges will be reversed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not receive your Device, please contact <a href=
        "//support.google.com/googleplay/?hl=en#topic=2411735&amp;rd=2">Google Play Support</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any delivery dates or times provided by Google (or a delivery agent) are estimates only and
        are not guaranteed.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Pricing Mistakes
      </h3>
      <p>
        We try very hard to make sure there are no mistakes in the prices that appear on the Google
        Play store. In the unlikely event that a mistake happens, you agree that Google will not be
        bound by that incorrect price, unless your credit card, debit card or other payment method
        in your Google Wallet account has already been charged. If a mistake is discovered and you
        haven't been charged yet, we will let you know the correct price and you will be given the
        option to continue with your order at the correct price or cancel it.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Order Limits
      </h3>
      <p>
        You may not order more than the maximum number of Devices that we specify from time to
        time. For example, the Google Play store may contain a maximum order limit for a particular
        Device.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Import and Export
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Device may be subject to import and export laws and regulations in the United States
        and elsewhere. You must comply with all domestic and international import and export laws
        and regulations that apply in connection with the Device. These laws may include
        restrictions on destinations, users, and end use.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Use of the Device
      </h3>
      <p>
        Please carefully read any instructions that come with the Device, including instructions
        that may be available online. In order to make use of any enhanced functionality of your
        Device, you may have to sign in to your Google account or open a Google account if you do
        not yet have one. Further, you agree to comply with any software license agreements
        applicable to your use of software on the Device. Google may also provide software
        updates/upgrades that you will need to install in order to make the best possible use of
        the functionality of your Device and/or Google services on your Device. Use of that
        software may be subject to additional licensing terms.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Resale and Gifts
      </h3>
      <p>
        You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any
        Device, but you may give the Device as a gift. Recipients of gifts may need to open and
        maintain a Google Wallet account in order to receive any support offered by Google. These
        Terms apply to any gift recipient.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Device Technical Specifications
      </h3>
      <p>
        Battery life for your Device, as described in any Device description page, will depend on
        device settings, usage, and many other factors. Battery tests are conducted using specific
        Device units; actual results may vary. Devices with storage capacity may be preformatted
        with operating system software and other files. As a result, actual formatted capacity will
        be less than the memory listed in any Device description page on the Google Play store.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Return Policy
      </h3>
      <p>
        Returns and refunds are governed by our Return Policy, which is available <a href=
        "//support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2411741?hl=en">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Data and Deactivation
      </h3>
      <p>
        You are responsible for managing any data stored on your Device, including, for example,
        deleting, transferring and creating back-ups of such data. For example, if you decide to
        cancel your order and return the Device, or if you have to send a Device to Google for
        replacement, it is your responsibility to erase all personal or other data on the Device
        before sending it to Google. Google will not be responsible for any use or disclosure of
        any data that resides on a Device.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you tell Google that you have not received your Device, the Device is defective, or it
        has been lost or stolen, Google may deactivate that Device. Deactivation does not
        automatically delete personal or other data stored on your Device. We strongly recommend
        that you back-up your data periodically.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Defects; Warranties; Disclaimer of Warranties
      </h3>
      <p>
        If the Device is or becomes defective through no fault of your own, you may be entitled to
        a refund, replacement, or repair of your Device. Please always refer to the manufacturer
        for any manufacturer warranty, as described in the <a href=
        "//support.google.com/googleplay/go/warranty">Warranty Center</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a defective Device, please contact <a href=
        "//support.google.com/googleplay/?hl=en#topic=2411735&amp;rd=2">Google Play Support</a>. If
        the Device is manufactured by a third party, Google may refer you to the applicable
        manufacturer of the Device for support with Device defects. If Google provides you with a
        replacement Device, you agree that Google may exchange the defective Device with either a
        new or refurbished Device. If Google provides you with a replacement Device before we
        receive your defective Device, and you do not return the defective Device within 21 days
        from the date the replacement Device is delivered to you, you authorize Google to charge
        your Google Wallet account for the replacement Device, not to exceed the amount paid for
        the original Device. Nothing in this section affects your legal rights under applicable
        laws. Unless otherwise required under applicable laws, Google may only provide warranty
        support for Devices manufactured by Google that are located in a supported country, as
        described in the <a href=
        "//support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2462844?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2803008">Country
        Availability</a> Page.

      <p>
        OTHER THAN THE WARRANTIES REFERRED TO IN THE <a href=
        "//support.google.com/googleplay/go/warranty">WARRANTY CENTER</a>, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
        PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, GOOGLE AND THE DEVICE MANUFACTURERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL
        WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING ANY DEVICES,
        INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
        NON-INFRINGEMENT.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Limitation of Liability
      </h3>
      <p>
        YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
        GOOGLE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, INCLUDING SUPPLIERS (COLLECTIVELY, "GOOGLE
        PARTIES") SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (WHETHER CONTRACT, TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL
        OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEVICE OR THESE
        TERMS, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT A GOOGLE PARTY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES
        HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES
        ARISING. YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
        APPLICABLE LAW, THE GOOGLE PARTIES' TOTAL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEVICE OR THESE
        TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO GOOGLE UNDER THESE TERMS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some states or countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
        consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Device Features Outside of Google’s Control
      </h3>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that unless specifically provided in any Device description page, no Device
        comes with a cellular data plan, a wireless service plan or other Internet connectivity
        service. You are solely responsible for obtaining any access to the Internet through a
        cellular data service provider or a wireless service provider (each, a “<strong>Wireless
        Carrier</strong>”) or other Internet connectivity service provider ("<strong>Internet
        Service Provider</strong>") whose service is compatible with the Device. If your Device
        includes functionality allowing you to access the Internet via a cellular data plan, the
        Device may be configured to work with a certain cellular network technology. Check with
        your Wireless Carrier for compatibility and mobile data plan availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your Device requires a SIM card, or any other mobile connectivity feature required by
        your Wireless Carrier or Internet Service Provider, you are solely responsible for
        obtaining such connectivity feature(s). If your Device includes WiFi functionality that
        allows you to access the Internet, you understand that you will need access to an
        802.11a/b/g/n WiFi access point.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree that, unless specifically provided in any Device description page, Google has no
        responsibility for the provision of cellular data services, wireless services or other
        Internet connectivity services, or the terms under which Wireless Carriers or Internet
        Service Providers may offer those services. Internet Service Providers and Wireless
        Carriers may charge you for usage and other fees that Google does not control.
      </p>
      <p>
        You understand that the Device may only be compatible with certain hardware accessories
        manufactured by third parties, and Google makes no warranty with respect to such
        third-party hardware accessories or their compatibility with the Device.
      </p>
      <p>
        Returning the Device, in accordance with these Terms, does not cancel your service contract
        with your Internet Service Provider or Wireless Carrier, if applicable, so you must contact
        your Internet Service Provider or Wireless Carrier (and any other applicable service
        provider(s)) directly to cancel such service(s).
      </p>
      <h3>
        Governing Law and Jurisdiction
      </h3>
      <p>
        The laws of California, U.S.A. apply to these Terms, excluding California’s choice of law
        rules, and will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms. Claims
        arising out of or relating to these Terms will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and
        venue of the courts in Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Changes to the Terms
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Terms in effect at the time you place an order for the Device will apply to such order
        and Device. Google reserves the right to make changes to these Terms from time to time, and
        any such changes will apply to future orders.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Events Beyond Reasonable Control
      </h3>
      <p>
        Neither party will be responsible for any delay or failure to comply with these Terms if
        the delay or failure arises from any cause which is beyond its reasonable control.
      </p>
      <h3>
        No Waiver
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you do not comply with these Terms, and we don't take action right away, this doesn't
        mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the
        future).
      </p>
      <h3>
        Severability
      </h3>
      <p>
        If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other
        terms.
