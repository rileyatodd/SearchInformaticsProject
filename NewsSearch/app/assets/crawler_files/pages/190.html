<p>Some schools were closed out of fear the disease could spread in large gatherings while others had no access to water, making handwashing impossible. But the longer a child stays out of school, the <a href="http://teachunicef.org/sites/default/files/documents/gcb_stopebola_11_11.pdf" target="_blank">less likely it is he or she will return</a>&mdash;which is why UNICEF is working closely with the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health to come up with protocols necessary to implement in order to let children back into the classrooms. The draft&mdash;which calls for measures like Ebola screenings, hygiene requirements and a plan in the event a suspected case&mdash;is currently being reviewed by experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. and the World Health Organization.</p>
<p><strong>MORE:</strong><a title=" TIME's Person of the Year: Ebola Fighters" href="time.com/poy" target="_blank"> TIME&#8217;s Person of the Year: Ebola Fighters</a></p>
<p>In the meantime, UNICEF and partner NGOs have trained out-of-work teachers to act as &#8220;social mobilizers,&#8221; going door to door to spread messages about how to identify Ebola and prevent its spread. UNICEF and partners are also using the radio programs to offer long-distance learning while kids are kept at home. &#8220;We are trying to make [the radio shows] simple and more interesting so children will get some learning,&#8221; says Aoki. &#8220;If they listen to it at a certain time of the day during the week, it gives them a routine they&rsquo;ve lost from not going to school. It brings them a sense of normalcy, some sort of stability and hope.&#8221;</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3637570"></div>
<p>Stability has been largely destroyed for many children living in Ebola-affected countries. Many have seen family members, friends and neighbors get infected, and many have <a href="http://time.com/3453660/ebola-orphans/" target="_blank">become orphans</a> as well. Ebola has also changed social mores. &#8220;Nobody shakes hands in public,&#8221; says Aoki. &#8220;It has put a lot of stress on children. There&#8217;s no cuddling, no hugging, no kissing. The simple joys of life have been taken away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even before Ebola, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia were economically troubled countries still emerging from conflict and civil war. Guinea and Liberia were in the process of increasing their school attendance numbers&mdash;Guinea was at 58% and Liberia was at 34%&mdash;and experts worry that Ebola has set progress back. School closures, including private schools, are also a bad economic indicator. Jeff Trudeau, the director of The <a href="http://www.aismonrovia.com/" target="_blank">American International School of Monrovia</a> (AISM) <a href="http://time.com/3161227/ebolas-untold-tragedy-foreign-families-are-fleeing/" target="_blank">told TIME in August</a> that he lost more than half his expected students for the 2014 school year, many of whom were children of foreign families who moved to the region for jobs in Liberia&#8217;s burgeoning business sector. That school&#8217;s earliest possible start date is January and for others, there appear to be &#8220;moving&#8221; deadlines for reopening. Guinea is aiming for January while Liberia and Sierra Leone are hoping for March.</p>
<p>But all the countries will have to patiently wait until their caseloads are under control, since a premature opening may only add fuel to the fire.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3637570"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

But the longer a child stays out of school, the <a href=\"http:\/\/teachunicef.org\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/gcb_stopebola_11_11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">less likely it is he or she will return<\/a>&mdash;which is why UNICEF is working closely with the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health to come up with protocols necessary to implement in order to let children back into the classrooms. The draft&mdash;which calls for measures like Ebola screenings, hygiene requirements and a plan in the event a suspected case&mdash;is currently being reviewed by experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. and the World Health Organization.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE:<\/strong><a title=\" TIME's Person of the Year: Ebola Fighters\" href=\"time.com\/poy\" target=\"_blank\"> TIME&#8217;s Person of the Year: Ebola Fighters<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, UNICEF and partner NGOs have trained out-of-work teachers to act as &#8220;social mobilizers,&#8221; going door to door to spread messages about how to identify Ebola and prevent its spread. UNICEF and partners are also using the radio programs to offer long-distance learning while kids are kept at home. &#8220;We are trying to make [the radio shows] simple and more interesting so children will get some learning,&#8221; says Aoki. &#8220;If they listen to it at a certain time of the day during the week, it gives them a routine they&rsquo;ve lost from not going to school. It brings them a sense of normalcy, some sort of stability and hope.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3637570\"><\/div>\n<p>Stability has been largely destroyed for many children living in Ebola-affected countries. Many have seen family members, friends and neighbors get infected, and many have <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3453660\/ebola-orphans\/\" target=\"_blank\">become orphans<\/a> as well. Ebola has also changed social mores. &#8220;Nobody shakes hands in public,&#8221; says Aoki. &#8220;It has put a lot of stress on children. There&#8217;s no cuddling, no hugging, no kissing. The simple joys of life have been taken away.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Even before Ebola, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia were economically troubled countries still emerging from conflict and civil war. Guinea and Liberia were in the process of increasing their school attendance numbers&mdash;Guinea was at 58% and Liberia was at 34%&mdash;and experts worry that Ebola has set progress back. School closures, including private schools, are also a bad economic indicator. Jeff Trudeau, the director of The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aismonrovia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">American International School of Monrovia<\/a> (AISM) <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3161227\/ebolas-untold-tragedy-foreign-families-are-fleeing\/\" target=\"_blank\">told TIME in August<\/a> that he lost more than half his expected students for the 2014 school year, many of whom were children of foreign families who moved to the region for jobs in Liberia&#8217;s burgeoning business sector. That school&#8217;s earliest possible start date is January and for others, there appear to be &#8220;moving&#8221; deadlines for reopening. Guinea is aiming for January while Liberia and Sierra Leone are hoping for March.<\/p>\n<p>But all the countries will have to patiently wait until their caseloads are under control, since a premature opening may only add fuel to the fire.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3637570\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=5%20Million%20Kids%20Aren%E2%80%99t%20in%20School%20Because%20of%20Ebola%20%7C%20TIME&body=5%20Million%20Kids%20Aren%E2%80%99t%20in%20School%20Because%20of%20Ebola%0A%0AChildren%20from%20Guinea%2C%20Sierra%20Leone%20and%20Liberia%20are%20still%20out%20of%20school.%20Here%27s%20what%27s%20being%20done%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3637570%2F5-million-kids-arent-in-school-because-of-ebola%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3637570%2F5-million-kids-arent-in-school-because-of-ebola%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-fgiu&text=5%20million%20kids%20aren%27t%20in%20school%20because%20of%20Ebola&via=TIMEHealth\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3637570%2F5-million-kids-arent-in-school-because-of-ebola%2F&title=5+Million+Kids+Aren%E2%80%99t+in+School+Because+of+Ebola\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3637570\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3637570\/5-million-kids-arent-in-school-because-of-ebola\/\" data-title=\"5 Million Kids Aren&amp;#8217;t in School Because of Ebola\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Health","slug":"health","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/health\/","description":"The latest health news, trends, and commentary from TIME, covering medicine, mental health, diet, fitness, sex, aging, disease, healthcare, policy and more","health":true},"tag":{"name":"ebola","slug":"ebola","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/ebola\/"},"tags":"Children|ebola|Ebola outbreak|Education|Guinea|Liberia|public schools|Schools|Sierra Leone|UNICEF","hero":{"class":"landscape","mini":"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/school-ebola-closed.jpg?crop=1592px%2C704px%2C1459px%2C1459px&resize=74%2C74","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/school-ebola-closed.jpg?crop=1592px%2C704px%2C1459px%2C1459px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/school-ebola-closed.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/school-ebola-closed.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/school-ebola-closed.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/school-ebola-closed.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Mohammed Elshamy\u2014Anadolu Agency\/Getty Images","caption":"A classroom of a school stands abandoned on Aug. 25, 2014 in Kenema, Sierra Leone.

It marks the most significant change in the U.S.-Cuba relationship since the Cuban revolution.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Neither the American nor Cuban people are served by a rigid policy that&rsquo;s rooted in events that took place before most of us were born,&rdquo; Obama said in a televised address. &#8220;I believe we can do more to support the Cuban people and our values through engagement. After all, these 50 years have shown the isolation has not worked. It&rsquo;s time for a new approach.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Following a year of secret back-channel talks in Canada and at the Vatican, and culminating with a historic nearly-hour-long call between Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro on Tuesday, the Cuban government released 65-year old Alan Gross on Wednesday on humanitarian grounds. His release clears the way for a broad relaxation of the 53-year U.S. embargo on Cuba.<\/p>\n<p>In a prisoner swap, Cuba released an unnamed U.S. intelligence asset who has been imprisoned for 20 years, while the U.S. government released the final three members of the spy ring known as the &#8220;Cuban Five&#8221; remaining in federal prison.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3637610\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>A senior administration official said the U.S. embassy would open &#8220;as soon as possible&#8221; in Havana.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Gross departed Cuba Wednesday morning on a U.S. government plane, and arrived at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, D.C., shortly after 11 a.m., accompanied by members of Congress and his wife who had traveld to retrieve him aboard a U.S. Air Force plane. <span style=\"font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;\">A Cuban court convicted Gross of espionage in 2011 and sentenced him to 15 years in prison for carrying communications devices into Cuba while working as as a subcontractor for United State Agency for International Development setting up Internet access in local communities. According to his attorney, Gross had been in deteriorating health while in prison. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Speaking at a news conference, Gross thanked Obama, said he supports the President&#8217;s policy shift and stressed he harbors no ill will toward the Cuban people.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;It pains me to see them treated so unjustly as a consequence of two governments&#8217; mutually belligerent policies,&#8221; Gross said. &#8220;Five-and-a-half decades of history shows us that such belligerence inhibits better judgment. Two wrongs don&#8217;t make a right.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;This is a game-changer which I fully support,&#8221; Gross added. &#8220;I truly hope we can get beyond these mutually-belligerent policies.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>MORE: <\/b><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3637603\/alan-gross-cuba\/\" target=\"_blank\">What to know about Alan Gross<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The Obama Administration is maximizing the ability of Americans to travel to Cuba within the limits of the American travel ban, The President is &#8220;doing everything in his authority to facilitate travel within the limits of the law,&#8221; an official said, adding that the Obama would support congressional efforts to lift the ban. Obama also announced that his administration is easing economic and financial restrictions on Cuba, including increasing permitted American exports, as well as raising the cap on remittances. U.S. financial institutions will also be allowed to open accounts at Cuban banks to process permitted transactions, and U.S. credit and debit cards will be permitted for use in Cuba for the first time. Obama is also directing Secretary of State John Kerry to launch an immediate review of the 1982 designation of Cuba as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, in consultation with intelligence agencies.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I do not expect the changes I&rsquo;m announcing today to bring about a transformation of Cuban society overnight,&rdquo; Obama said.<\/p>\n<p>Obama cannot unilaterally lift the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I look forward to engaging Congress in an honest and serious debate about lifting the embargo,&#8221; he said.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3637483\"><\/div>\n<p>In an address that took place while Obama was speaking, Castro said he welcomes the cooling of relations between the two countries, but that differences remain that the countries need to learn to live with &#8220;in a civilized manner.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"1\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video-3948296516001-1\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-fgh5\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3948296516001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<p>Obama has twice-previously relaxed restrictions on Cuba in 2009 and 2011, opening the door for Americans to visit family members in Cuba and allowing travel for religious, educational and cultural endeavors. Authorized American travelers will now be able to import up to $400 in Cuban goods into the U.S., including $100 in tobacco and alcohol products. But senior Administration officials said there would be no immediate change to the ban on imports of Cuban cigars and other products for retail purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Obama&#8217;s announcement was quickly criticized by Republicans and Democratic lawmakers who have long defended the embargo. Outgoing Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) blasted Obama&#8217;s decision as having &#8220;vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;This asymmetrical trade will invite further belligerence toward Cuba&#8217;s opposition movement and the hardening of the government&rsquo;s dictatorial hold on its people,&#8221; Menendez said.<\/p>\n<p>American officials contend that the U.S. policy toward Cuba was antiquated and ineffective, failing to bring down the Castro regime after more than 50 years. Obama said he respects the &#8220;passion&#8221; of those who may disagree with his decision, but said he believes now was the time for a change. &#8220;I do not believe that we can do the same thing for over five decades and expect a different result,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>In coordination with the American announcements, the Cuban government will announce that it will free 53 prisoners deemed by the U.S. to be political prisoners, American officials said. Additionally, the Cuban government has told the U.S. it intends to expand Internet connectivity for its citizens. But despite objections by the Cuban government, the U.S. will continue to fund so-called democracy programming in Cuba, meant to promote human rights and support the free-flow of information into the communist country.<\/p>\n<p>American officials praised the role of Canada and the Vatican, particularly Pope Francis, in helping bring about the agreement.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Pope Francis personally issued an appeal in a letter that he sent to President Obama and to President Raul Castro calling on them to resolve the case of Alan Gross and the cases of the three Cubans who have been imprisoned here in the United States, and also encouraging the united states and cuba to pursue a closer relationship,&#8221; an official said, calling the papal letter &#8220;very rare. &#8230; The Vatican then hosted the U.S. and Cuban delegations where we were able to review the commitments that we are making today.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In a statement earlier this month marking the five-year anniversary of Gross&#8217; arrest, Obama said that if the Castro-led Cuban government released him it would set the stage for other reconciliation efforts.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Cuban Government&rsquo;s release of Alan on humanitarian grounds would remove an impediment to more constructive relations between the United States and Cuba,&#8221; Obama said.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=U.S.%20and%20Cuba%20Move%20to%20Thaw%20Relations%20After%20Prisoner%20Exchange%20%7C%20TIME&body=U.S.%20and%20Cuba%20Move%20to%20Thaw%20Relations%20After%20Prisoner%20Exchange%0A%0AAlan%20Gross%27%20release%20brings%20an%20immediate%20cooling%20of%20tensions%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3637483%2Falan-gross-cuba-barack-obama%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3637483%2Falan-gross-cuba-barack-obama%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-fgh5&text=U.S.%20and%20Cuba%20move%20to%20thaw%20relations%20after%20prisoner%20exchange&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3637483%2Falan-gross-cuba-barack-obama%2F&title=U.S.+and+Cuba+Move+to+Thaw+Relations+After+Prisoner+Exchange\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3637483\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3637483\/alan-gross-cuba-barack-obama\/\" data-title=\"U.S. and Cuba Move to Thaw Relations After Prisoner Exchange\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Those chains control nearly half of the movie screens in the U.S., according to the <em>Journal.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>NBC News previously <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/theaters-pull-sonys-interview-after-hacker-threat-violence-n269761\" target=\"_blank\">reported<\/a> that Carmike had decided to pull the plug on <em>The Interview. <\/em>Deadline <a href=\"https:\/\/deadline.com\/2014\/12\/sony-theater-owners-pull-the-interview-terror-threats-1201327612\/\" target=\"_blank\">reported<\/a> late Tuesday that California&#8217;s ArcLight Cinemas, which runs five theaters across the state, also won&#8217;t show the film, but a spokesperson later said no official decision had yet been made.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Landmark Cinemas has cancelled <em>The Interview&#8217;s <\/em>New York City premiere, which was set for Thursday evening. That cancellation comes as the film&#8217;s co-stars, Seth Rogen and James Franco, already backed out of several media events around the films.<\/p>\n<p>The threat, which may or may not have come from the same people who hacked Sony Pictures, intimated at the possibility of attacks on theaters that choose to show the movie, a completely fictional comedy about journalists recruited by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong Un<em>. &#8220;<\/em>We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time,&#8221; read the message, with &#8220;the places&#8221; apparently referring to theaters showing the film. The message also invoked the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.<em><br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p>While Sony is at this point going ahead with the film&#8217;s Christmas Day release, sources <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/theaters-pull-sonys-interview-after-hacker-threat-violence-n269761\" target=\"_blank\">told<\/a> NBC News that the company won&#8217;t punish theaters that back out. The Department of Homeland Security, meanwhile, has said there&#8217;s no &#8220;credible intelligence&#8221; regarding an attack on movie theaters in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>The threat also coincided with a new release of Sony employees&#8217; emails, several weeks after hackers breached Sony Pictures&#8217; systems and posted troves of company and employee confidential data online. Early reports linked the hacks to North Korea, which is reportedly furious over <em>The Interview&#8217;s <\/em>plot about killing the North Korean leader. However, North Korea denied conducting the attack, and the little evidence thus far tying the country to the incident is circumstantial.<\/p>\n<p>The total fallout of the Sony attack is still incalculable, but it could amount to the most damaging corporate cyberattack in history.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3637680\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"3\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video-3797679049001-3\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-fgip\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3797679049001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3637565\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=These%20Are%20the%20Theaters%20That%20Have%20Pulled%20The%20Interview%20After%20Threat%20%7C%20TIME&body=These%20Are%20the%20Theaters%20That%20Have%20Pulled%20The%20Interview%20After%20Threat%0A%0ALaw%20enforcement%20says%20there%27s%20no%20credible%20threat%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3637565%2Finterview-theaters-cancel%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3637565%2Finterview-theaters-cancel%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-fgip&text=These%20theaters%20won%27t%20show%20The%20Interview%20after%20violent%20threat&via=TIMEBusiness\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3637565%2Finterview-theaters-cancel%2F&title=These+Are+the+Theaters+That+Have+Pulled+The+Interview+After+Threat\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3637565\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3637565\/interview-theaters-cancel\/\" data-title=\"These Are the Theaters That Have Pulled &lt;i&gt;The Interview&lt;\/i&gt;

They are all bad.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>However, analysts contend that factions within the security services continue to see militant groups inside Pakistan as valuable proxies in the battle for influence in neighboring Afghanistan and Kashmir.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that there are elements within the military establishment who are willing to sustain or willing to endure civilian causalities and even military casualties as long as some broader strategic objective is met,&rdquo; Hassan Javid, associate professor of political science at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, tells TIME.<\/p>\n<p>But as Javid argues, the country&rsquo;s brutal experience with insurgency has long demonstrated that these groups can never be controlled.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Given the ideologies that motivate these groups, and given the links they have to other such groups, I think its inevitable that they will turn their guns on Pakistan,&rdquo; says Javid. &ldquo;Even if they&rsquo;re working with them today, there&rsquo;s always the possibility they will turn around and bite the hand that&rsquo;s been feeding them a few years down the line.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3635583\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>Following the attacks, a spokesperson with the Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, said the assault on the school was retaliation against the ongoing <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/2931289\/pakistan-north-waziristan-taliban-offensive-refugees\/\">offensive<\/a> in the country&rsquo;s tribal belt.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We selected the army&#8217;s school for the attack because the government is targeting our families and females,&#8221;

But the longer a child stays out of school, the <a href=\"http:\/\/teachunicef.org\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/gcb_stopebola_11_11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">less likely it is he or she will return<\/a>&mdash;which is why UNICEF is working closely with the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health to come up with protocols necessary to implement in order to let children back into the classrooms. The draft&mdash;which calls for measures like Ebola screenings, hygiene requirements and a plan in the event a suspected case&mdash;is currently being reviewed by experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. and the World Health Organization.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE:<\/strong><a title=\" TIME's Person of the Year: Ebola Fighters\" href=\"time.com\/poy\" target=\"_blank\"> TIME&#8217;s Person of the Year: Ebola Fighters<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, UNICEF and partner NGOs have trained out-of-work teachers to act as &#8220;social mobilizers,&#8221; going door to door to spread messages about how to identify Ebola and prevent its spread. UNICEF and partners are also using the radio programs to offer long-distance learning while kids are kept at home. &#8220;We are trying to make [the radio shows] simple and more interesting so children will get some learning,&#8221; says Aoki. &#8220;If they listen to it at a certain time of the day during the week, it gives them a routine they&rsquo;ve lost from not going to school. It brings them a sense of normalcy, some sort of stability and hope.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3637570\"><\/div>\n<p>Stability has been largely destroyed for many children living in Ebola-affected countries. Many have seen family members, friends and neighbors get infected, and many have <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3453660\/ebola-orphans\/\" target=\"_blank\">become orphans<\/a> as well. Ebola has also changed social mores. &#8220;Nobody shakes hands in public,&#8221; says Aoki. &#8220;It has put a lot of stress on children. There&#8217;s no cuddling, no hugging, no kissing. The simple joys of life have been taken away.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Even before Ebola, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia were economically troubled countries still emerging from conflict and civil war. Guinea and Liberia were in the process of increasing their school attendance numbers&mdash;Guinea was at 58% and Liberia was at 34%&mdash;and experts worry that Ebola has set progress back. School closures, including private schools, are also a bad economic indicator. Jeff Trudeau, the director of The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aismonrovia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">American International School of Monrovia<\/a> (AISM) <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3161227\/ebolas-untold-tragedy-foreign-families-are-fleeing\/\" target=\"_blank\">told TIME in August<\/a> that he lost more than half his expected students for the 2014 school year, many of whom were children of foreign families who moved to the region for jobs in Liberia&#8217;s burgeoning business sector. That school&#8217;s earliest possible start date is January and for others, there appear to be &#8220;moving&#8221; deadlines for reopening.

Ever since he came to power in 2000, Putin presented himself as the antidote to what Russians call the &ldquo;wild &rsquo;90s,&rdquo; the decade of economic upheaval that culminated in the crash of 1998. The high price of oil, and the fortunes it brought the Russian petrostate, have since allowed Putin to keep his promise of prosperity and economic growth. But this week the myth of Putin the Stabilizer collapsed, along with the value of the national currency.<\/p>\n<p>Driven down by a six-month plunge in the price of oil, the ruble lost about a quarter of its value against the dollar in the first two days of this week, its steepest fall since the crash of 1998, when Russia defaulted on its debt. The central bank took drastic measures to avoid the risk of another default on Monday night, hiking interest rates from 10.5% to 17% in a desperate attempt to make Russians keep their rubles in the bank instead of spending them on foreign currency. But it came too late. The rate hike, also the steepest since 1998, only managed to forestall the collapse of the ruble for about 10 minutes when markets opened on Tuesday morning.<\/p>\n<p>Putin, meanwhile, kept his head in the sand. Reporters who called his spokesman with questions about the ruble&rsquo;s fall were told to call the Prime Minister or the Cabinet, as though the economy was not the President&rsquo;s concern. The most notable item on the Kremlin&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/kremlin.ru\/assignments\/47240\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a> on Tuesday was a presidential order to prepare a &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; history of the region of Crimea, which Putin annexed from Ukraine this spring. Though it was hardly a tonic for the national economy, this decree hinted at Putin&rsquo;s plan for riding out the storm.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"6\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video-2682407037001-6\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-ffYd\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"2682407037001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<p>The annexation of Crimea, which drove Putin&rsquo;s approval ratings to record highs this year, is still the main pillar propping up his popularity. But that is not likely to remain the case, according to Lev Gudkov, head of Russia&rsquo;s leading independent pollster, the Levada Center. &ldquo;The more people are connected to the market economy, the more critical they are of the rhetoric and demagoguery of our President,&rdquo; Gudkov wrote in an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.levada.ru\/16-12-2014\/vsled-za-ekonomicheskim-mozhet-priiti-sotsialnyi-krizis\" target=\"_blank\">analysis<\/a> published on Tuesday. By spring, he predicted, public discontent would reach down to the poorest and least educated segments of the population, as economic realities they see all around them stand in ever starker contrast to the rosy picture presented on Russian state TV.<\/p>\n<p>The government admitted as much on Tuesday. &ldquo;We are ending the year with 15.7 million poor people nationwide,&rdquo; said Olga Golodets, the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of social affairs. &#8220;And in the context of inflation their numbers will inevitably grow, especially among families with children,&rdquo; she <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interfax.ru\/russia\/413323\" target=\"_blank\">told a meeting<\/a> of officials and social workers.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a startling prospect for a nation that has seen a steady decline in the poverty rate since Putin came to power. But when the Cabinet held an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss the ruble crisis, the ministers failed to come up with any concrete measures to prevent the economy from sinking into a deep depression next year. Already there is talk of Russia being forced to introduce <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/raoulruparel\/2014\/12\/16\/rouble-rout-means-capital-controls-could-be-on-the-cards-for-russia\/\" target=\"_blank\">capital controls<\/a>, or imposing restrictions on foreign trading to make it harder to sell off rubles. That might be enough to save the economy, but it would damage domestic firms and outrage the business elites who have been among Putin&#8217;s closest supporters.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3636313\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>MORE: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3630352\/mikhail-gorbachev-vladimir-putin-cold-war\/\" target=\"_blank\">Gorbachev Blames the U.S. for Provoking &#8216;New Cold War&#8217;<\/a><\/p>\n<p>As the recession takes hold, the state&rsquo;s most reliable means of deflecting public outrage will, as usual, involve blaming the West. So far pro-Kremlin news outlets have tended to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bPQvTYuGePc\" target=\"_blank\">avoid blaming<\/a> the fall in the oil price on some kind of American conspiracy, but Putin will be tempted to offer the public such fables as the economy continues to sink. &ldquo;This is the only answer,&rdquo; says Kirill Petrov, chief analyst at Minchenko Consulting, a Kremlin-connected political-advisory firm. &ldquo;This line would be effective, at least in the short term.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Still, the Kremlin seems to recognize that, in the longer term, it cannot continue its struggle with the West over Ukraine without piling ever more strain on the Russian economy. That much has been clear from Putin&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3624192%2Fputin-russia-ukraine-speech-cut-censored%2F&amp;ei=QouQVJfbJYvZaoGngMgI&amp;usg=AFQjCNGdjD6nJLeNyzNOAiBtag7xpPf-5w&amp;sig2=ru6rAzorY2Zn13A0PSgJ2w&amp;bvm=bv.81828268,d.bGQ\" target=\"_blank\">softer tone<\/a> toward Ukraine during the recent drop in the ruble&#8217;s value. On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov even <a href=\"http:\/\/itar-tass.com\/en\/russia\/767292\" target=\"_blank\">denied<\/a> that Moscow has &ldquo;any difficulties&rdquo; in its dialogue with Ukrainian leaders, and his American counterpart, Secretary of State John Kerry, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2014\/12\/16\/us-russia-rouble-kerry-idUSKBN0JU1UC20141216\" target=\"_blank\">said<\/a> the same day that Russia has been making &ldquo;constructive moves&rdquo; toward resolving the Ukrainian conflict.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not likely to be enough to persuade the U.S. to ease the pressure on Russia&rsquo;s economy. Indeed, President Barack Obama is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2014\/12\/16\/us-usa-russia-congress-idUSKBN0JU26120141216\" target=\"_blank\">expected later this week<\/a> to sign a bill piling more sanctions on Russian state companies and businessmen. That may provide fresh ammunition for Putin&rsquo;s anti-American rhetoric, but it could worsen what is already a dire economic situation at home. And if the President continues trying to dismiss those problems as the necessary price of his foreign policy, the core promise of stability that he made to his people upon taking power will crumble along with his country&#8217;s currency. At this rate of economic decline, the &#8220;wild &rsquo;90s&#8221; could wind up feeling tame in comparison with what&#8217;s to come.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"7\"

In November, he mentioned the &#8220;joy in my heart&#8221; when asked by the Wall Street <em>Journal<\/em> about a presidential run. Then on Monday, at a commencement address in the primary state of South Carolina, he implored students to reach for joy in all they did. &#8220;I think we need to have candidates lift our spirits,&#8221; he said, one day before announcing his formal intention to explore a campaign. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty pessimistic country right now.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3631750\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That&#8217;s the bet of the third man named Bush to pursue the presidency in three decades. After a 13 years of relentlessly bad news and increasingly divisive politics, the former Sunshine State governor thinks the country might just be ready for some sunshine of its own. Joy will be his weapon against who accuse him of ideological weakness, hereditary entitlement or establishment blandness. If he ever does face Hillary Clinton in a general election campaign, he can repurpose the vibe to counter rival whose laugh has been so honed by political necessity as to echo in mechanical rhythms.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Relentless and even irrational optimism, of course, is not a novel pose for a presidential contender, but it is hard to remember a candidate so committed to a psychological analysis of the political landscape this early in the cycle. To hear Bush tell it, the nation is &#8220;mopey,&#8221; beaten down by war, economic stagnation and the furious politics that accompany each.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3636062\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Bush, the solutions are right in front of all of us, if only we can pop some Prozac and kick the blues: Reform the immigration system to flood the nation with brilliant entrepreneurs from a abroad, open the taps of domestic energy production, kick the K-12 education system in the rear and fix the tax, regulatory and entitlement nonsense that hangs like a weight around our future. &#8220;We are moping around like we are France,&#8221; he said on Dec. 1. &#8220;The crisis of opportunity is we are not seizing the moment. We are not aspiring to be young and dynamic again.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3506143\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To his own party, the shrink&#8217;s critique has a neat corollary. &#8220;You don&#8217;t do well in bringing people together if you are carping, criticizing, turning around and saying you are not as good as me,&#8221; he said in an interview with Florida reporters broadcast on Sunday.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That line of attack&mdash;which transfers the fight from ideology to feeling&mdash;could serve him well in what is certain to be a brutal primary against a monstrously unwieldy field of politicians far more conservative, religious and attuned to tapping the ever-evolving grassroots Id than him. It&rsquo;s also a message that is likely to work against his most fearsome rival for the establishment crown, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whose spirit animal is more carnivorous than cuddly.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;He is going to be a very effective candidate if he runs, because he is going to talk about the future without backing down or pandering to the Tea Party side,&#8221; explains Charlie Black, a Republican lobbyist who&#8217;s long run in presidential politics started in 1976 on the Ronald Reagan campaign.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The question for Bush is whether there are enough Republicans left, and partial to voting in early primary states, who will put the promise of glee before their deep feelings of grievance and need for reform. Bush last ran for public office in 2002, long before conservatives, libertarians and the Tea Party decided that his family&#8217;s tradition of big government conservatism was the problem, not the solution. As Bush has wisely observed, his best route victory in 2016 will require him to lose the debate stage policy argument in the primary while still finding a way to get more votes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That&#8217;s a tough circle to square if all you are working with are facts and figures. But joy exists outside the realm of what is. That&#8217;s why we all seek it out: To make something else of who we are.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3636062\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Jeb%20Bush%20Bets%20on%20a%20Sunshine%20State%20of%20Mind%20%7C%20TIME&body=Jeb%20Bush%20Bets%20on%20a%20Sunshine%20State%20of%20Mind%0A%0AThe%20son%20and%20brother%20of%20Presidents%20past%20moves%20towards%20a%20campaign%20of%20his%20own%20built%20around%20a%20psychological%20diagnosis%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3636062%2Fjeb-bush-joy-presidential-campaign%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3636062%2Fjeb-bush-joy-presidential-campaign%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-ffUa&text=Jeb%20Bush%20bets%20on%20a%20Sunshine%20State%20of%20mind&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3636062%2Fjeb-bush-joy-presidential-campaign%2F&title=Jeb+Bush+Bets+on+a+Sunshine+State+of+Mind\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3636062\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3636062\/jeb-bush-joy-presidential-campaign\/\" data-title=\"Jeb Bush Bets on a Sunshine State of Mind\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

data-ob-template=\"timemag\"><\/div><\/aside><p>Shares of cruise-line operators sailed to big gains on Wednesday as investors placed a bet that improving relations between the U.S. and Cuba could lead to new opportunities for tourism.<\/p>\n<p>Shares of Carnival, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean all rose in early trading Wednesday, outpacing the Dow Jones Industrial Average, after the Obama administration said it plans to lift <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/american-alan-gross-released-from-cuba-after-5-years-in-prison-1418825981?mod=WSJ_Home_largeHeadline\" target=\"_blank\">many of its existing travel restrictions on Cuba<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The new regulations will make it easier for Americans to visit to Cuba under the 12 categories of travel that are currently allowed, <em>The Wall Street Journal<\/em> reported, though it isn&rsquo;t immediately clear if or when the island will be open for mass tourism. Some kinds of tourism are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/news\/national\/u-s-cuba-deal-caps-cigar-imports-100-article-1.2048432\" target=\"_blank\">still banned<\/a>, according to various media reports,.<\/p>\n<p>Still, Cuba is appealing to companies with the most to gain from the increased travel. The tropical island&rsquo;s attractive beaches and proximity to the United States makes it a potential vacation hotspot. The Caribbean is already the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cruising.org\/sites\/default\/files\/leadershipforum2013\/3B.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">largest cruise line market in the world<\/a>, and Americans hop on the industry&rsquo;s bulky ships more than any other nation.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/204572\/revenue-of-the-cruise-line-industry-worldwide-since-2008\/\" target=\"_blank\">cruise line operators<\/a> already have strong links to the Caribbean. For example, nearly all of Norwegian&rsquo;s ships <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1513761\/000119312514062855\/d662798d10k.htm\" target=\"_blank\">serve the region<\/a>. The Caribbean also makes up roughly 35% of Carnival&rsquo;s passenger capacity, more than any other region. That means that if the U.S. were to allow its citizens to freely visit Cuba, many of the cruise industry&rsquo;s ships are already in prime position to dock at Havana and other Cuban cities.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/12\/17\/cruise-line-shares-cuba\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>This article originally appeared on Fortune.com<\/em><\/a><\/p><aside

the spirits maker that was founded in Cuba and later exiled from the country in 1960, says it hopes for better lives for Cubans following the Obama Administration&rsquo;s decision to normalize diplomatic relations with the Caribbean island.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We hope for meaningful improvements in the lives of the Cuban people and will follow any changes with great interest,&rdquo; Bacardi said in an e-mailed statement. &ldquo;In the meantime, we continue to support the restoration of fundamental human rights in Cuba.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Bacardi says it&rsquo;s taking a wait-and-see approach on Cuba after the United States on Wednesday said it would <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/12\/17\/u-s-cuba-thaw-relations\/\" target=\"_blank\">open an embassy on the island nation<\/a> following the release of a U.S. government subcontractor from prison. It marked the most significant change in the U.S.-Cuba relationship in decades.<\/p>\n<p>Bacardi, which makes rum, Dewar&rsquo;s Scotch and Grey Goose vodka, has close historic ties to Cuba even though it hasn&rsquo;t operated there for more than five decades. The company was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bacardilimited.com\/PressRelease\/FactSheet\" target=\"_blank\">founded in Santiago de Cuba in 1862<\/a>, and in 1910, became the nation&rsquo;s first multi-national company when it opened bottling operations in Spain.<\/p>\n<p>When Prohibition started in 1920, Cuba and Bacardi benefited from increased influx of Americans to the island for a stiff drink.<\/p>\n<p>But relations between the company and Cuba soured greatly in 1960, when Bacardi&rsquo;s operations were nationalized by the government following the Communist takeover there. At that point, Bacardi had operations in five other countries, including the U.S. and Mexico, and was able to bounce back. The company is now headquartered in Bermuda, but still touts its Cuban history.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Bacardi is proud of its Cuban roots,&rdquo; a company representative said in a statement on Wednesday. &ldquo;We have the utmost respect and sympathy for the Cuban people with whom we share a common heritage.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><a

His final writing credit, &#8221;Monologues,&#8221; takes the family to England in a joke-dense episode filled with allusions to <em>Trainspotting<\/em>, <em>My Fair Lady<\/em>, and James Bond, and features a cameo by a sitting head of state (Tony Blair), as well as big-name Brits Ian McKellen and J.K.

In this season 8 standout, the Simpson clan leaves Springfield behind when Homer gets a new job at the Globex Corporation &mdash; a mysterious mega-company run by friendly-seeming ginger Hank Scorpio (Albert Brooks, giving his best <em>Simpsons<\/em> guest performance). Gradually, it becomes clear (to everyone but Homer) that Scorpio&#8217;s actually a ruthless supervillain hell-bent on defeating secret agent James Bont. It&#8217;s an absurd setup bolstered by one of the show&#8217;s best laughs-per-minute ratios. Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse us, we have to take a trip to Hammocks-R-Us; it&#8217;s in the Hammock District.<\/p>\n<p><strong>23. &#8220;Lisa&#8217;s First Word&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Dec. 3, 1992<br \/>\nThe best <em>Simpsons<\/em> episodes aren&#8217;t only hilarious&mdash;they&#8217;re also poignant, showcasing the big, beating heart beneath the series&#8217; occasionally caustic satire. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the show&#8217;s early flashback episodes, including &#8221;The Way We Was,&#8221; &#8221;I Married Marge,&#8221; and &#8221;And Maggie Makes Three&#8221;&mdash;the latter of which ends with what may be the most <a href=\"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/a\/ab\/Simpsons6x13.jpg\" target=\"_NEW\">heartwarming image<\/a> ever seen on TV. Of that stellar quartet, though, &#8221;Lisa&#8221; reigns supreme, thanks both to its emotional high points (the titular event, which shines a spotlight on Lisa and Bart&#8217;s relationship; its closing moment, in which Maggie (played by guest star Elizabeth Taylor, of all people) says her own first word, &#8221;Daddy&#8221;) and its barrage of ace jokes (Bart&#8217;s &#8221;spout medley,&#8221; &#8221;It&#8217;s not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child, but somehow I managed to fit in eight hours of TV a day,&#8221; &#8221;can&#8217;t sleep, clown&#8217;ll eat me&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p><strong>22. &#8220;Hurricane Neddy&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Dec. 19, 1996<br \/>\nHomer&#8217;s mild-mannered nemesis had a few spotlight episodes before this one&mdash;but none were as juicy as &#8221;Hurricane Neddy,&#8221; which digs into just what makes Springfield&#8217;s model citizen tick. It all starts when Hurricane Barbara sweeps through town, sparing most residents&mdash;except the devout, endlessly generous Flanders clan, who lose everything they own. (Ned doesn&#8217;t have insurance because he considers it a form of gambling.) What follows is half an hour of darkly-tinted soul searching in which Ned questions his faith (&#8221;I&#8217;ve done everything the Bible says, even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! I&#8217;ve even kept kosher, just to stay on the safe side&#8221;), finally gives the rest of Springfield a piece of his mind (Moe: &#8221;Hey, I may be ugly and hate-filled, but I&#8230; um, what was the third thing you said?&#8221;), then checks himself into a mental hospital. One of the series&#8217; darker installments, to be sure&mdash;but it&#8217;s also relentlessly hilarious and quotable (&#8221;I&#8217;m Dick Tracy! Take that, Pruneface! Now I&#8217;m Pruneface! Take that, Dick Tracy! Now I&#8217;m Prune Tracy!&#8217; Take that, Dick&#8230;&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p><strong>21. &#8220;Who Shot Mr. Burns? Parts 1 and 2&#8243;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> May 21, 1995; Sept. 17, 1995<br \/>\nA two-part comedic homage to <em>Dallas<\/em>&#8216;s &#8221;Who shot J.R.?&#8221; stunt, &#8221;WSMB?&#8221; is perhaps<em>The Simpsons<\/em>&#8216;s most grandiose pop moment ever. An atypical outing, too: Satiric potshots (O.J. Simpson, Madonna, and <em>Twin Peaks<\/em>) and gut-busting randomness (Moe&#8217;s marathon lie-detector session is a classic) are subordinate to a methodically plotted murder mystery that, alas, climaxes with a cop-out, albeit a deliberate one. (Maggie did the deed&mdash;accidentally, of course.) There&#8217;s no way it could have approached the ratings for the <em>Dallas<\/em> cliffhanger, but it&#8217;s still a pivotal marker in the show&#8217;s evolution. By deftly deploying <em>The Simpsons<\/em>&#8216;s array of supporting characters (even Doctor Colossus!), this onetime anti-<em>Cosby<\/em> lightning rod demonstrated what a rich, self-sustaining universe it had become.<\/p>\n<p><strong>20. &#8220;Radio Bart&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Jan. 9, 1992<br \/>\nHomer tries to top his past gifts to Bart (a shoe tree and shelf paper) with a Mr. Microphone-style radio. The boy immediately drops it down a well and begins broadcasting plaintive cries for help as Timmy O&#8217;Toole. A ridiculous media circus ensues: Hucksters sell authentic Timmy baby teeth, and guest voice Sting leads an overblown, &#8221;We Are the World&#8221;-style ballad called &#8221;We&#8217;re Sending Our Love Down the Well.&#8221; In the end, Timmy&#8217;s story is bumped off the front page by a squirrel who resembles Abraham Lincoln, and Sting&#8217;s ditty gets booted from No. 1 by Funky C Funky Do&#8217;s &#8221;I Do Believe We&#8217;re Naked.&#8221; It&#8217;s a media parody so sharp, we&#8217;re still stinging a bit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>19. &#8220;Simpsons Spin-off Showcase&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> May 11, 1997<br \/>\n&#8221;Could <em>The Simpsons<\/em> ever maintain its popularity without Moe the bartender?&#8221; asks Troy McClure. &#8221;Let&#8217;s hope so &mdash; because Moe is leaving to do his own sitcom.&#8221; This send-up of spin-offs has it all, from odd pairings (Grampa Simpson&#8217;s spirit inhabits a love-tester machine in Moe&#8217;s bar) to awkward cameos (says Lisa to Chief Wiggum, newly relocated to New Orleans: &#8221;I can&#8217;t wait to hear about all the exciting, sexy adventures you&#8217;re sure to have against this colorful backdrop&#8221;). But &#8221;The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour&#8221; is the strongest of the three spawn &mdash; a searing homage to one of the most dreadful spin-offs ever, <em>The Brady Bunch Hour<\/em>. The Waylon Smithers Dancers and <em>Hee Haw<\/em> interstitials are a hoot, but memo to Fox: Don&#8217;t be getting any ideas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>18. &#8220;Flaming Moe&#8217;s&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Jan. 21, 1991<br \/>\nMoe laments his poor business: &#8221;Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself.&#8221; Then Homer invents a new drink, for which Moe takes credit. The &#8221;Flaming Moe&#8221; turns his bar into a raging success (a velvet-rope policy begins, Aerosmith perform &#8221;Walk This Way,&#8221; and Moe hires a comely new bartender). &#8221;Flaming Moe&#8217;s&#8221; is a crucial addition to <em>The Simpsons<\/em>&#8216;s liquor canon, with a <em>Cheers<\/em> parody that includes a sobering theme song (&#8221;Liquor in a mug\/Can warm you like a hug&#8221;). Extra attraction: Bart actually apologizes for making a prank call to Moe&#8217;s. Remorse and fiery mixed drinks&mdash;does it get much better?<\/p>\n<p><strong>17. &#8220;Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Oct. 2, 1994<br \/>\nBased on those cartoonishly violent killer critters, Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land is the theme-park realization of Bart&#8217;s most extreme daydreams &mdash; no wonder he and Lisa beg to go there for a family trip. What&#8217;s waiting for the Simpsons when they arrive&mdash;besides two gargantuan parking lots, of course&mdash;is actually a smart riff on the Disney empire: There are shots at Walt&#8217;s lame character spin-offs (Klu Klux Clam, anyone?), a dig at his speculated sordid past (Itchy &amp; Scratchy&#8217;s creator turns out to be a Nazi sympathizer), and a nod to the park&#8217;s mollifying grown-up attractions (the booze-filled &#8221;Parents&#8217; Island&#8221;). When the animatronics attack, the showdown between man and machine&mdash;okay, Homer and a giant robot mouse&mdash;is an uproarious rebuttal to capitalism run amok.<\/p>\n<p><strong>16. &#8220;Homer at the Bat&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Feb. 20, 1992<br \/>\nWhen Mr. Burns recruits nine all-star major-leaguers for his company softball team, what ensues is less an indictment of America&#8217;s pastime than a loopy celebration of the sport&#8217;s long-lost innocence, a paean to pro sluggers as both heroes (Jose Canseco misses the big game because he&#8217;s rushing into a burning house to rescue a baby&mdash;and a cat, and a player piano&#8230;) and softies (Darryl Strawberry sheds a tear at Bart and Lisa&#8217;s bleacher heckling). It was also early proof that <em>The Simpsons<\/em> could juggle a squad of guest stars without giving the family short shrift: Who drives in the winning run when a ball bounces off his head? Homer, of course.<\/p>\n<p><strong>15. &#8220;Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> April 14, 1996<br \/>\nWorking with animation grants the writers of <em>The Simpsons<\/em> the liberty to do things that live-action shows can only dream of. They can create a supporting cast that&#8217;s several dozen characters deep and produce episodes that rely on elaborate concepts rather than on straightforward plots. &#8221;Twenty-Two&#8230;&#8221; plays to these strengths. Taking its title (if nothing else) from the movie &#8221;Thirty-two Short Films About Glenn Gould,&#8221; the outing is a Whitman&#8217;s Sampler of Springfieldians, giving such fan favorites as Snake, Chief Wiggum, and Dr. Nick Riviera their brief moments at center stage. (It even finds time to supply the hillbilly Cletus with a toe-tapping theme song.) If that&#8217;s not enough, it wedges in a priceless &#8221;Pulp Fiction&#8221; parody, replete with a nuanced discussion of the difference between Krusty Burger and McDonald&#8217;s. Let&#8217;s see a Chuck Lorre joint try that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>14. &#8220;The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Sept. 21, 1997<br \/>\nThe show that dares ask the question &#8221;Why did I drink all that crab juice?&#8221; A bingeing Barney ditches Homer&#8217;s car in the Big Apple, prompting a family trip to retrieve it. Change-of-venue episodes are typically uninspired, but this &#8221;City&#8221; is frantically busy &mdash; skewering foreign-food vendors (five words: Khlau Kalash on a Stick), crazy subway dudes, and gawking tourists. A Broadway parody about the Betty Ford clinic called <em>Kickin&#8217; It<\/em> is uncomfortably catchy; even bits about the Twin Towers are so clever, you&#8217;ll smile instead of wincing. Plus, Marge offers an admonition for anti-Gothamites: &#8221;Of course you&#8217;ll have a bad impression of New York if you only focus on the pimps and the C.H.U.D.&#8217;s.&#8221; Put that on a T-shirt, and we&#8217;ve got something.<\/p>\n<p><strong>13. &#8220;I Love Lisa&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Feb. 11, 1993<br \/>\nLisa gives sad little Ralph Wiggum a Valentine&#8217;s Day pity card, featuring a smiling train and a special greeting. &#8221;You Choo-Choo-Choose Me?&#8221; marvels a desperately happy Ralph. Anyone who&#8217;s suffered an unrequited crush will find these 30 minutes wonderfully squirmy. Lisa ignores Homer&#8217;s advice for warding off Wiggum (&#8221;Six simple words: I&#8217;m not gay, but I&#8217;ll learn&#8221;) and ends up dumping him live on Krusty&#8217;s 29th Anniversary Show (&#8221;You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half,&#8221; enthuses Bart, watching in slo-mo). But &#8221;I Love Lisa&#8221; ultimately reveals the show&#8217;s unexpected sweet side, as when Ralph cheerfully reads a make-up card from a repentant Lisa: &#8221;&#8217;Let&#8217;s Bee Friends.&#8217; It says &#8216;bee&#8217; and has a picture of a bee on it!&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3638567\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>12. &#8220;Duffless&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Feb. 18, 1993<br \/>\nFor years, we chuckled at Homer&#8217;s sloppy, overheated love for beer. But all that hilarious brain-cell killing was never really addressed&#8230;until this episode, in which Homer&mdash;riding high on a Duff brewery tour buzz&mdash;gets busted for DWI and reluctantly heeds Marge&#8217;s request to quit drinking for a month. Not only does &#8221;Duffless&#8221; tweak an unrelenting alcohol culture (a billboard flips between &#8221;Friends Don&#8217;t Let Friends Drive Drunk&#8221; and &#8221;It&#8217;s Always Time for Duff&#8221;), it deftly depicts poignant, if grudging, emotional growth for Homer: After bemoaning his newfound sobriety at a baseball stadium (&#8221;I never realized how boring this game is&#8221;), he forgoes a reward beer to bike into the sunset with Marge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>11. &#8220;The Last Temptation of Homer&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Dec. 9, 1993<br \/>\nWhen Mr. Burns is forced to hire a female employee at the plant, Homer is suddenly very attentive at work. There&#8217;s plenty Homer admires about Mindy Simmons (voiced to slinky perfection by Michelle Pfeiffer): gluttony, sloth, and, he suspects, outrage that &#8221;&#8217;Ziggy&#8221;s gotten too preachy!&#8221; Of course, we know that Homer will stay faithful, his marriage having already survived Jacques the bowling instructor and a giant catfish named General Sherman. But it&#8217;s Homer&#8217;s anguished journey (&#8221;Oh no, I&#8217;m sweating like Roger Ebert!&#8221;)&mdash;and a memorable cameo by Colonel Klink of <em>Hogan&#8217;s Heroes<\/em>&mdash;that makes getting there so great. It&#8217;s no <em>Scenes From a Marriage<\/em>, but it&#8217;s a hell of a lot more amusing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10. &#8220;Treehouse of Horror V&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Oct. 30, 1994<br \/>\n<em>Simpsons<\/em> Truism No. 666: &#8221;Treehouse&#8221; episodes are as inconsistent as Grampa&#8217;s bladder. Welcome to the exception. &#8221;The Shinning&#8221; is a parody brimming with such detail, comic timing (&#8221;No TV and no beer make Homer&#8230;something something&#8221;), and Kubrick send-ups that it ranks with the greatest of pop-culture spoofs. &#8221;Time and Punishment&#8221; features Homer&#8217;s time-traveling toaster and one of the most beautifully random moments in <em>Simpsons<\/em> history (Homer: &#8221;Don&#8217;t panic. Remember the advice your father gave you on your wedding day.&#8221; Grampa in thought bubble: &#8221;If you ever travel back in time, doooooonnnn&#8217;t step on anything&#8230;&#8221;). Maybe &#8221;Nightmare Cafeteria&#8221; doesn&#8217;t shine as brilliantly, but we think it&#8217;s perfectly, well, &#8221;cromulent.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>9. &#8220;Mr. Plow&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Nov. 19, 1992<br \/>\n&#8221;Call Mr. Plow, that&#8217;s my name\/That name again is Mr. Plow!&#8221; Those 12 words of insipid brilliance stand testament to one of the few times Homer has actually succeeded at something. As Springfield&#8217;s No. 1 snow mover, Homer&mdash;rather incredibly&mdash;earns some extra money, the gratitude of Mayor Quimby, and the amorous adoration of Marge (She: &#8221;Would you mind&#8230;?&#8221; He: &#8221;Cutting my nails? Brushing my teeth?&#8221;). But Homer finds competition&mdash;and even betrayal&mdash;from&#8230;Barney? A curiously dark episode (we learn that Homer is responsible for Barney&#8217;s alcoholism) in which escalating tensions come to a head on icy Widow&#8217;s Peak. Not exactly laugh-a-minute, but oh, that jingle&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. &#8220;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy and Poochie Show&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Feb. 9, 1997<br \/>\nHey, kids! Who likes scathing commentary on aging TV series? In this provocative, self-referential spectacle that polarized a nation (okay, some particularly rabid fans),<em>Itchy &amp; Scratchy<\/em>&#8216;s falling ratings prompt the network suits to introduce a painfully overhip canine. (&#8221;You&#8217;ve heard the expression, &#8216;Let&#8217;s get busy&#8217;? Well, this is a dog who gets biz-zay.&#8221;) The Homer-voiced Poochie provides perfect fodder for aggressive meta-lampoonery: As Lisa criticizes the desperate character-adding act, a hipster teen named Roy is seen inexplicably chillin&#8217; with the Simpson clan. No cow is sacred here, not even <em>The Simpsons<\/em>&#8216;s increasingly nitpicky fans, who are milked for laughs in the Comic Book Guy&#8217;s &#8221;Worst Episode Ever&#8221; didacticism. Worst ever? Hardly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. &#8220;Homer&#8217;s Phobia&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Feb. 16, 1997<br \/>\n<em>The Simpsons<\/em> gets away with more hot-button hotdoggery than any other show, and the most cunning example may be this flamboyant installment, in which the family befriends John (John Waters), the droll owner of a kitschy collectibles shop&#8230; until Homer finds out that he&#8217;s gay. For a man who once called a spoon &#8221;the metal dealie&#8230;you use&#8230;to dig&#8230;food,&#8221; Homer attains a new level of keg-headedness in his foolish paranoia (&#8221;He didn&#8217;t give you gay, did he?&#8221;) and absurd anger toward John for not mincing around and declaring his orientation (&#8221;You know me, Marge&mdash;I like my beer cold, my TV loud, and my homosexuals fa-laaaming!&#8221;). But the same-sex silliness never turns offensive, perhaps because of the sincere subtext: By worrying that John is going to convert Bart, Homer actually fears that he hasn&#8217;t been a good father&mdash;thus explaining the accidental visit to the gay steel mill. Hot (and funny) stuff, coming through!<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. &#8220;Lisa the Vegetarian&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Oct. 15, 1995<br \/>\nIn the early days, Bart and Homer were the Simpson family&#8217;s &mdash; and the show&#8217;s&mdash;undisputed breakout stars. Talk to <em>Simpsons<\/em> writers, though, and you&#8217;ll discover something interesting: A critical mass name Lisa&mdash;nerdy, earnest, principled, perpetually misunderstood Lisa&mdash;as <a href=\"http:\/\/usatoday30.usatoday.com\/life\/television\/news\/story\/2012-02-15\/insider-guide-to-favorite-simpsons-episodes\/53110250\/1\" target=\"_NEW\">their favorite Simpson of all<\/a>. Which means this list needs a Lisa episode&mdash;and not a Lisa episode that&#8217;s really a Bart episode (&#8221;Lisa&#8217;s First Word&#8221;) or a Lisa episode that&#8217;s really a Ralph episode (&#8221;I Love Lisa&#8221;). (Don&#8217;t agree? Go back to Russia!) And which Lisa episode is better than &#8221;Lisa the Vegetarian,&#8221; in which the smartest kid in Springfield first realizes the unsettling connection between the lamb she just met at a petting zoo and the chops Marge is serving that very night? But there&#8217;s more to this half-hour than Lisa&#8217;s awakening; her meat-eschewing highlights her relationship with Homer, one of the show&#8217;s most interesting dynamics, and also leads to a few of the series&#8217; catchiest gags. Sing it with me now: <em>You don&#8217;t win friends with sal-ad!<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>5. &#8220;A Fish Called Selma&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> March 24, 1996<br \/>\nYou may remember Troy McClure from such TV shows as &#8221;The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular,&#8221; but in his splashiest turn, the underemployed actor is plagued by a &#8221;romantic abnormality.&#8221; &#8221;Gay? I wish!&#8221; says the closeted fish fetishist, who becomes a family man by marrying Marge&#8217;s sister Selma (the one with a repetitive stress injury from scratching her butt). Hollywood lampoons are well-tread ground for the show, but this take on the scandal-contrition cycle, featuring the wonderful McClure vehicle <em>Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!<\/em>, is particularly smart. And Selma&#8217;s farewell to McClure is also a touching tribute to the man who supplied his voice, the late Phil Hartman: &#8221;Goodbye, Troy. I&#8217;ll always remember you, but not from your films.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. &#8220;Rosebud&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Oct. 21, 1993<br \/>\nIt begins with <em>Citizen Kane<\/em>, ends somewhere near the &#8221;Planet of the Apes,&#8221; and in between, manages to find time to include Hitler, the Ramones, and 64 slices of American cheese. But despite being one of <em>The Simpsons<\/em>&#8216;s most spectacularly overstuffed episodes, &#8221;Rosebud&#8221; has plenty of heart, though it is the Mephistophelian ticker belonging to Mr. Burns, who, on the eve of his birthday&mdash;somewhere north of 100&mdash;finds himself pining for Bobo, his long-lost teddy bear. Burns and Smithers&#8217; efforts to retrieve the tattered toy from Maggie show why they&#8217;ll always be TV&#8217;s most functional dysfunctional couple: Smithers (who fantasizes about his boss jumping out of a birthday cake) isn&#8217;t happy unless his boss is happy&mdash;which happens only after an empathetic Maggie gives Bobo up. It&#8217;s a moment that proves even Springfield&#8217;s twisted billionaire can learn to love&mdash;though he conveniently forgets how a few seconds later.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. &#8220;Last Exit to Springfield&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> March 11, 1993<br \/>\nThis episode is virtually flawless, the product of a series at the height of its creative powers&mdash;when the satire was savage and relevant, when names like John Swartzwelder, George Meyer, and Conan O&#8217;Brien were relatively unknown, when Maude Flanders lived. So it is that we find America&#8217;s favorite family at Painless (formerly &#8221;Painful&#8221;) Dentistry, because Lisa is in need of braces. Meanwhile, at the nuclear plant, Mr. Burns is trying to ax the union dental plan. The rest is the stuff of syndication legend: Burns facing down &#8221;brilliant&#8221; labor kingpin Homer Simpson; Homer Simpson facing down his own brain (&#8221;Lisa needs braces\/DENTAL PLAN!&#8221;); Grampa rattling on about wearing onions on his belt. &#8221;Last Exit&#8221; is a glorious symphony of the high and the low, of satirical shots at unions and sweet ruminations on the humiliations of adolescence (as evidenced by Lisa, who copes with a medieval mouth contraption), and, of course, all those &#8221;D&#8217;oh!&#8221;s. The things, in other words, that make us love <em>The Simpsons<\/em> in the first place.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. &#8220;Cape Feare&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Oct. 7, 1993<br \/>\n<em>The Simpsons<\/em> is, at its heart, one big parody, but even Homer Thompson could recognize &#8221;Cape Feare&#8221; as the show&#8217;s most meticulous and manic pop-culture takeoff. Not only is it a pitch-perfect send-up of the Martin Scorsese remake (with Kelsey Grammer&#8217;s Sideshow Bob traveling to Terror Lake to hunt down and murder his pint-size nemesis, Bart), but it also features one of the most bizarre scenes in television history. We&#8217;re referring, of course, to the rakes. Think about it. How many other series would waste valuable prime-time real estate by showing a man whacking himself in the face with a garden rake not once, not twice, but NINE TIMES?!? If ever there was a gag genius in its repetitive stupidity (progressing from funny to not so funny to the funniest thing ever), this is it&mdash;merely the sharpest cut in an entire episode that just plain kills.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. &#8220;Marge vs. the Monorail&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Airdate:<\/strong> Jan. 14, 1993<br \/>\nFast-talking huckster Lyle Lanley (Phil Hartman, natch) sells the town a faulty monorail; only through Marge&#8217;s intervention is the town saved. That&#8217;s the plot of &#8221;Marge vs. the Monorail,&#8221; but it&#8217;s not the point. The point is that the episode has arguably the highest throwaway-gag-per-minute ratio of any <em>Simpsons<\/em>, and all of them are laugh-out-loud funny. You want parodies? In its first five minutes, &#8221;Monorail&#8221; skewers <em>The Flintstones,<\/em> <em>Beverly Hills Cop,<\/em> <em>The Silence of the Lambs,<\/em> and<em>Batman.<\/em> Celebrity cameos? Leonard Nimoy bores the town with tales from the <em>Star Trek<\/em> set. <em>Simpsons<\/em> in-jokes? Country star Lurleen Lumpkin, from &#8221;Colonel Homer,&#8221; has a bit part. A musical number? <em>The Music Man<\/em>&#8216;-inspired &#8221;The Monorail Song&#8221; is, well, inspired. Elaborate visuals that were clearly devised by a roomful of overgrown boys? This episode features giant remote-controlled mechanical ants, a radioactive squirrel, an escalator to nowhere, and&mdash;in case we haven&#8217;t mentioned it already&mdash;Leonard Nimoy. Thus we proclaim: Best. Episode. Ever.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ew.com\/ew\/gallery\/0,,20883466,00.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>This article originally appeared on EW.com<\/em><\/a><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module

As it turns out, men also have some hormonal waves prior to becoming dads.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ajhb.22670\/abstract\" target=\"_blank\">New research<\/a> published in the <i>American Journal of Human Biology <\/i>looked at 29 couples expecting their first child. The researchers took salvia samples of the participants and measured their levels of the hormones testosterone, cortisol, estradiol, and progesterone. The couples&#8217; hormones were measured at weeks 12, 20, 28, and 36 of pregnancy.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s long been proven that expectant women undergo hormonal changes, but less is known about the soon-to-be-papas. The new study shows that while women had increases in all four types of hormones, men had decreases in their testosterone and estradiol levels, but no significant changes in cortisol or progesterone.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the first research to evidence that prenatal testosterone changes can occur in expectant fathers, though the changes are still small compared to those observed in women.<\/p>\n<p>The researchers did not compare the couples to other non-expectant couples, so exactly how great these changes are compared to couples who aren&#8217;t expecting kids is undetermined. And scientists were unable to conclude <em>why <\/em>men experience these changes, though there are some speculations based on prior research.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, prior studies have suggested that men&#8217;s hormones change after becoming fathers as they adopt more nurturing behaviors. Or that drops in testosterone may reflect sleep disruptions or disruptions in sexual activity due to having kids. Some of these same behaviors may happen during pregnancy too. The psychological, emotional and behavioral changes of new parenthood could also cause hormonal waves in expectant dads.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 6\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 6\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&#8220;It will be important for future research to determine whether the changes that we observed in men&rsquo;s hormones reflect processes associated with fatherhood specifically, or long-term pair-bonding more generally,&#8221; the authors concluded.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\"

And those tensions can be especially confusing for kids, who often feel things deeply, but don&rsquo;t always have the language to express those feelings.<\/p>\n<p>We talked with Rob Zucker, grief counselor and author of <em>The Journey Through Grief and Loss: Helping Yourself and Your Child When Grief is Shared<\/em>, to learn what parents can do to help kids cope with loss in the midst of the holidays.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Elementary age kids<\/strong> &ldquo;are very sensitive to the emotional realm,&rdquo; Zucker says. But they don&rsquo;t always know why they feel the way they do. And they&rsquo;re still trying to figure out how a loss will affect their world, like the six-year old boy Zucker worked with who asked, &ldquo;Will we still have Christmas?&rdquo; after his grandmother&rsquo;s death. For a parent who is also grieving, the questions young kids ask can be tough to deal with. But Zucker says they can also be seen as an opportunity to help kids start to put their feelings into words, and try to make sense of the changes in their world. So be open to questions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Late elementary and middle school kids<\/strong> are beginning to grasp some big concepts surrounding loss. But that understanding can lead a lot of anxiety, Zucker says. Older kids can reason, &ldquo;if grandma died, then grandpa might die.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important for them to be able to share these feelings, Zucker says. So encourage them to talk freely when they begin to open up about their sadness or worry. But it&rsquo;s also important for parents to assure kids that life is about more than loss. And the holidays, while they can bring up sad memories, are also full of opportunities to celebrate life, by asking questions like what good times they remember, or what good times they&rsquo;re looking forward to.<\/p>\n<p><strong>High school kids<\/strong> &ldquo;can really struggle with managing intense feelings,&rdquo; Zucker says. And at the same time, they take a more intellectual view of loss than other kids, which can lead to them making comparisons between their lives and the idealized ones they see in advertisements. Zucker suggests that parents work through this tension by creating a story that honors the uniqueness of their family, even if it looks different than what kids might see in glossy advertising: Parents and kids can do this together, Zucker says, when parents start conversations with questions like &ldquo;What is unique about our family? What do we want to celebrate about who we are? What is special about our story?&rdquo; The goal, Zucker says: to give kids a chance to say: &ldquo;This is who we are.&rdquo; And no matter what is happening, &ldquo;we celebrate the love in our family.&rdquo;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3638460\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\"
