#   ruby part1-skel.rb document.txt
#

# # check that the user gave us 1 command line parameters
# if ARGV.size != 1
#   abort "Command line should have 1 parameter."
# end

# # fetch filename from the command line
# filename = ARGV[0]

# # load in the document
# words = read_file_into_list(filename)

# print "Analyzing " + filename + "...\n"

# # count number of words, using function above.
# word_count = count_words(words)
# print "  Number of words: " + word_count.to_s + "\n"
